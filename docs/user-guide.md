- name: "project_codebase"
  type: "codebase"
  description: "Existing project source code"
```

### 3. Create Task List

Define your tasks with structured phases:

```
Action: create_tasklist

```

### 4. Map Capabilities to Tasks

Assign specific tools to each task phase:

```
Action: map_capabilities
Parameters:
task_mappings:
- task_id: "task_abc123"

    assigned_builtin_tools:
    - tool_name: "read_file"
      usage_purpose: "Review existing code structure"
      specific_actions: ["Read package.json", "Review directory structure"]
      expected_outcome: "Understanding of current project state"
      priority: "critical"
  
  execution_phase:
    assigned_builtin_tools:
    - tool_name: "edit_file"
      usage_purpose: "Create new project files"
      specific_actions: ["Create package.json", "Set up directory structure"]

```

### 5. Execute Tasks

Get guided execution for each phase:

```
Action: execute_next
```

**Response provides:**
- Current task and phase information
- Assigned tools with detailed guidance
- Specific actions to take
- Expected outcomes
- Execution strategy

### 6. Mark Phases Complete

Progress through workflow phases:

```
Action: mark_complete
```

This automatically progresses from:
- Planning → Execution → Next Task

## Best Practices

### Task Organization

1. **Break Down Complex Tasks**
   - Split large tasks into manageable phases
   - Each task should have a clear, specific goal
   - Use descriptive task names

2. **Phase Structure**
   - **Planning**: Analysis, design, and preparation
   - **Execution**: Implementation and creation

3. **Tool Assignment**
   - Assign tools with specific purposes
   - Include expected outcomes
   - Set appropriate priorities

### Capability Declaration

1. **Be Comprehensive**
   - Declare all available tools
   - Include detailed descriptions
   - Specify tool capabilities accurately

2. **Resource Documentation**
   - Document available codebases
   - Specify resource types clearly
   - Include access information

### Workflow Management

1. **Session Organization**
   - Use descriptive session names
   - Group related tasks in single sessions
   - Clean up completed sessions

2. **Progress Tracking**
   - Mark phases complete promptly
   - Address any issues that arise during execution

## Configuration

### Server Configuration

Edit `config.yaml` to customize behavior:

```yaml
# State management
state_directory: 'taskmaster/state'
session_backup_count: 5

# Environment scanning
scanners:
  system_tool_scanner:
    enabled: true
    scan_interval: 300
```

### Environment Variables

- `PORT`: Server port (default: 9090)
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Logging verbosity (INFO, DEBUG, WARNING, ERROR)
- `SMITHERY_DEPLOY`: Deployment mode flag

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Server Won't Start

**Problem**: Port already in use
```
Error: [Errno 48] Address already in use
```

**Solution**: Change port or stop conflicting process
```bash
# Change port
PORT=8081 python server.py

# Or kill existing process
lsof -ti:9090 | xargs kill
```

#### Connection Issues

**Problem**: MCP client can't connect
```
Error: Connection refused
```

**Solutions**:
1. Verify server is running
2. Check firewall settings
3. Confirm correct URL in client config
4. Restart both server and client

#### Session Persistence Errors

**Problem**: Session state not saving
```
Error: Permission denied writing to state directory
```

**Solutions**:
1. Check directory permissions
2. Verify disk space
3. Review state_directory configuration

### Performance Tips

1. **Session Management**
   - End sessions when complete
   - Use descriptive session names
   - Regular cleanup of old sessions

2. **Task Organization**
   - Keep tasks focused and specific
   - Use appropriate phase structure
   - Assign tools efficiently

3. **Resource Usage**
   - Declare only needed capabilities
   - Use appropriate tool priorities
   - Monitor system resources
