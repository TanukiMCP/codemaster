Current wp-mcp has 2419 lines with solid foundations in authentication, content management, and basic REST API integration. Need to research current WordPress APIs as of July 2025, implement real plugin/theme operations, and build production-grade configuration management. Target is 100% functional EventPros specification execution.",
      "red": "Excitement about finally building the missing production pieces that will unlock wp-mcp's full potential. There's urgency to deliver real functionality rather than more placeholders. User clearly wants working code that actually executes WordPress operations. Feel confident about the strong foundation already in place, but concerned about potential API changes since the original implementation. The 'no placeholders' directive shows commitment to quality.",
      "black": "Major risks include WordPress API changes since original implementation, GeoDirectory plugin API endpoints may not exist as assumed, WP-CLI integration complexity, and potential security issues with plugin/theme installation. Time pressure to research current APIs thoroughly. Implementation complexity around file uploads, plugin dependencies, and error handling. Risk of breaking existing functionality while adding new features.",
      "yellow": "This enhancement will transform wp-mcp from partial automation to full production capability. Success means EventPros can be built with true automation, creating a reusable platform for any WordPress directory project. The Context7 integration will ensure we have the most current API information. Building on solid foundations with proper authentication and REST API integration already working. This could position wp-mcp as a leading WordPress automation solution.",
      "green": "Alternative approaches: Use WordPress.org APIs for plugin/theme installation, implement WP-CLI subprocess integration, create hybrid REST API + direct file operations, build plugin dependency management, implement atomic operations with rollback capabilities. Could also explore headless WordPress approaches or containerized development environments. Consider building a plugin installation queue system for better reliability.",
      "blue": "Systematic approach: 1) Research current WordPress APIs via Context7, 2) Implement plugin management with real WordPress.org integration, 3) Build theme management system, 4) Add WordPress configuration API, 5) Verify/fix GeoDirectory integration, 6) Add comprehensive error handling and rollback. Each component should be tested independently before integration. Maintain backward compatibility and add extensive documentation."

No placeholders, no mock implementations - only working, production-grade code.\n\n**CORE STRATEGY**: Research-driven implementation using current WordPress APIs (July 2025), building on existing solid foundations while maintaining backward compatibility and adding comprehensive error handling.\n\n**PRIMARY OBJECTIVES**:\n1. **Plugin Management Revolution**: Replace placeholder handlers with real WordPress.org API integration, dependency management, and secure installation processes\n2. **Theme Management System**: Implement complete theme lifecycle management including installation, activation, child theme creation, and customization\n3. **WordPress Configuration Engine**: Build comprehensive options/settings management with validation, backup, and rollback capabilities\n4. **GeoDirectory API Verification**: Confirm and implement actual GeoDirectory endpoints or build robust alternatives\n5. **Production Quality Assurance**: Add enterprise-grade error handling, atomic operations, and comprehensive logging\n\n**EXECUTION FRAMEWORK**: \n- **Research Phase**: Use Context7 to gather current WordPress API documentation and best practices\n- **Implementation Phase**: Build each component with full functionality, proper error handling, and comprehensive testing\n- **Integration Phase**: Seamlessly integrate new functionality while preserving existing capabilities\n- **Validation Phase**: Test against EventPros specification requirements to ensure 100% automation capability\n\n**SUCCESS CRITERIA**: EventPros specification executable with zero manual intervention, wp-mcp becomes enterprise-ready WordPress automation platform, all critical gaps eliminated with production-quality implementations."
