Current design lacks cohesion and uses custom styling that needs professional replacement. The goal is a client-ready directory website.",

Users expect seamless, modern directory experiences. The excitement lies in transforming this into a premium-quality website that event professionals would proudly use and clients would pay good money for. The emotional motivation is creating something genuinely professional and cohesive.",

GeoDirectory integration with DIVI layouts could be technically challenging. The scope is massive (47+ pages) with risk of incomplete implementation. Layout selection could lack cohesion if not carefully planned. User experience could suffer during transition. Time and resource constraints could lead to rushed implementation.",
      "yellow": "Optimistic outcomes: DIVI's 2000+ layouts provide enormous design flexibility for creating a cohesive professional appearance. GeoDirectory's robust functionality combined with DIVI's design system can create a premium directory experience. Successful implementation results in a client-ready website that could serve as a portfolio piece. Systematic approach ensures comprehensive coverage and professional quality throughout.",
      "green": "Creative alternatives: Instead of finding one directory pack, we can create a cohesive design family by selecting complementary layouts from business/service-oriented packs. We could develop custom DIVI modules specifically for directory functionality. Consider creating reusable layout templates that combine DIVI design with GeoDirectory shortcodes. Explore progressive enhancement approach - start with core functionality then enhance with advanced DIVI features.",
      "blue": "Process strategy: Use systematic page-by-page approach managed through taskmaster. First, audit and select cohesive DIVI layout family. Create comprehensive task list covering every user touchpoint. Implement in logical order: homepage \u2192 search \u2192 listings \u2192 forms \u2192 supporting pages. Test integration continuously. Maintain design cohesion through consistent layout family and style guidelines. Document approach for future maintenance."
