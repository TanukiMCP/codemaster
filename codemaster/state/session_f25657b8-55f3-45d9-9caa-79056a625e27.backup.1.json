      "white": "Factual Analysis: Tanuki-AIDE is an Electron-React-Express application requiring complete transformation from prototype to production. Current state has extensive mock implementations across services (visionAnalysisService, deepResearchService, taskmasterIntegrationService, mcpStoreService). Available MCP servers include taskmaster for orchestration, turingmcp for advanced AI capabilities, vision for visual analysis, and memory_palace for workspace memories. Need to integrate real cloud provider APIs (RunPod, Lambda Labs), implement proper state management, create animated UI components, establish secure VM sandbox, and build comprehensive tool calling system. Technical stack includes Material-UI, Monaco Editor, Framer Motion, Docker integration, and MCP protocol.",
      "red": "Emotional/Intuitive Analysis: This transformation feels like bringing a brilliant prototype to life - moving from 'impressive demo' to 'professional tool that developers will love using daily'. The extensive mock code suggests previous AI assistance created complexity without substance, which feels frustrating but also exciting to fix properly. Users will be thrilled to see tool calls animate beautifully like Cursor, to have real planning conversations with AI, and to safely execute code in isolated environments. The integration of memory_palace for workspace awareness and vision for AI 'eyes' feels revolutionary - creating an AI assistant that truly understands and remembers the development context.",
      "black": "Critical Analysis: Major risks include the massive scope potentially leading to incomplete implementation, integration complexity between multiple MCP servers could create instability, performance issues from poor architecture decisions might persist, security vulnerabilities in VM execution and tool calling could expose users, dependency conflicts between different MCP systems might cause runtime errors, and the ambitious memory palace integration could be technically challenging. The current mock code demonstrates how easy it is to create fake functionality that doesn't work - we must ensure every implementation is genuinely functional. Timeline pressure might force shortcuts that compromise quality.",
      "yellow": "Optimistic Analysis: This transformation will create a genuinely innovative AI development environment that surpasses existing tools. The combination of taskmaster orchestration, turingmcp capabilities, vision integration, and memory palace creates unprecedented AI assistant functionality. Real cloud provider integration will enable powerful development workflows impossible on local machines. The modular MCP architecture allows for extensibility and continuous improvement. The comprehensive refactoring will eliminate technical debt and establish proper patterns. Success will position Tanuki-AIDE as a leading AI development platform with unique capabilities that differentiate it from competitors like Cursor.",
      "green": "Creative Analysis: Consider implementing a plugin architecture that allows community extensions through MCP servers. Use feature flags for gradual rollout of new capabilities while maintaining stability. Implement real-time collaboration features leveraging the memory palace for shared workspace understanding. Create AI-driven code generation that combines vision analysis of existing patterns with memory of project context. Develop intelligent resource management that predicts VM needs based on task analysis. Build adaptive UI that learns user preferences through memory palace integration. Consider implementing AI pair programming mode where vision system watches development process and provides contextual assistance.",
      "blue": "Process Analysis: Execute transformation through systematic elimination of mock implementations while building real functionality in parallel. Establish integration testing early to validate MCP server communication. Use progressive enhancement approach - start with core functionality, then add advanced features. Implement comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms for external service dependencies. Create modular architecture that allows independent development of different integration systems. Establish clear boundaries between services to prevent coupling issues. Use taskmaster for orchestrating complex multi-step operations while maintaining user feedback and control. Prioritize user-facing improvements alongside backend integration work."
