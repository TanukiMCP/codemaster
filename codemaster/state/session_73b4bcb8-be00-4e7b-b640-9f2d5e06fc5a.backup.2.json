It features a React/TypeScript frontend, Python FastAPI backend with Stable Diffusion and LLM integration, optimized for RX 6600 8GB VRAM + 48GB RAM. The packaging infrastructure is largely implemented with electron-builder.yml, PyInstaller specs, build scripts, and GitHub Actions workflow. Key remaining tasks appear to be completing the packaging system (Task 21) and documentation/deployment (Task 22).",

The local-first approach feels empowering - no cloud dependencies, complete privacy. However, there's some concern about the complexity of the packaging system with both Python and Electron components, and whether all the optimization features will work seamlessly across different hardware configurations.",

The hardware optimization makes it practical for hobbyists with mid-range GPUs. The packaging system, once complete, will enable easy distribution and updates. The local-first approach eliminates privacy concerns and ongoing costs. Success will create a new category of accessible AI-powered creative tools.",
