      "white": "FACTS: Current wordpress_mcp_server.py is 5000+ lines with major architecture violations: hardcoded template generation, stub implementations returning mock data, massive Divi generation functions, and broken content from previous fixes. Good functions exist for core WordPress operations (posts, pages, media, users, WooCommerce, Divi CRUD) that properly use client.make_request(). WordPress REST API provides endpoints for /wp/v2/posts, /wp/v2/pages, /wp/v2/media, /wp/v2/users, authentication via application passwords, and comprehensive CRUD operations. Need modular structure with 8 handler modules: core_content, authentication, woocommerce, divi, geodirectory, content_management, theme_plugin, performance_seo.",
      "red": "EMOTIONAL: This refactor is exciting - it will transform a messy codebase into a professional, extensible MCP server that actually serves its purpose. I feel motivated to create clean architecture that the user can be proud of. There's satisfaction in removing thousands of lines of bad code and replacing them with focused, real WordPress integration. The user deserves a properly functioning tool that connects LLM agents to WordPress without fake responses.",
      "black": "RISKS: Major refactor could introduce bugs if not carefully executed. Risk of breaking existing functionality that works correctly. WordPress REST API has limitations for some operations (permalinks, global styles) that require manual steps. Some endpoints may need authentication/permissions that could complicate implementation. Large amount of code to review and categorize correctly. User expectations are high for production-quality results.",
      "yellow": "OPPORTUNITIES: This creates a truly professional WordPress MCP server that can serve as a model for other WordPress automation tools. Modular architecture enables easy extension and maintenance. Clean separation of concerns makes testing and debugging much easier. Elimination of hardcoded generation creates authentic WordPress integration. User will have a powerful tool for real WordPress development automation via LLM agents.",
      "green": "ALTERNATIVES: Could organize by CRUD operations instead of WordPress domains. Could create a plugin-style architecture where handlers register themselves. Could implement caching layer for frequently accessed WordPress data. Could add TypeScript definitions for better developer experience. Could create handler base classes with common WordPress API patterns. Could implement automatic API endpoint discovery.",
      "blue": "PROCESS: 1) Create core infrastructure (client, config, auth), 2) Extract and organize good functions by domain, 3) Remove all bad functions entirely, 4) Create clean handler modules with proper imports, 5) Update main server.py with modular structure, 6) Test that command routing works correctly, 7) Remove monolithic file. Each handler module must only contain functions that make real WordPress REST API calls or provide clear guidance for manual steps."

    "denoised_plan": "MISSION: Transform monolithic WordPress MCP server into clean, modular architecture with authentic WordPress REST API integration.\n\nARCHITECTURE VISION: Professional MCP server with 8 focused handler modules (core_content, authentication, woocommerce, divi, geodirectory, content_management, theme_plugin, performance_seo) that provide real WordPress integration for LLM agents.\n\nPURIFICATION STRATEGY: Extract ~50 good functions that properly use client.make_request() for WordPress REST API calls. Eliminate ~100+ bad functions with hardcoded generation, stubs, and template creation. \n\nMODULAR STRUCTURE:\n- core/ (client, config, auth infrastructure)\n- handlers/ (domain-specific WordPress API modules)\n- utils/ (shared utilities)\n- server.py (clean FastMCP entry point)\n\nQUALITY STANDARDS: Every handler function must make real WordPress REST API calls or provide clear manual guidance. No mock responses, no hardcoded generation, no template creation. Functions return actual WordPress data or appropriate error handling.\n\nSUCCESS METRICS: Reduce codebase from 5000+ lines to ~2000 clean lines. Enable LLM agents to perform authentic WordPress operations. Create extensible foundation for future WordPress automation."
