The project requires an Electron PWA with React/TypeScript, SQLite database, LM Studio integration for local LLM, and cross-device synchronization. I have access to file operations, terminal commands, and a Windows development environment. The existing curriculum follows Language Transfer methodology with cultural context for Moldova.",
      "red": "This feels like an exciting and meaningful project that will genuinely help people learn Romanian for real-world use. The Language Transfer approach is emotionally engaging and builds confidence. Users will feel accomplished as they progress through units, and the cultural focus on Moldova adds personal connection. The local LLM approach feels more private and trustworthy than cloud-based solutions.",
      "black": "Key risks include LM Studio integration complexity, cross-device synchronization challenges, and ensuring the LLM provides consistent educational quality. The 30-unit curriculum is extensive and needs careful state management. Electron apps can be resource-heavy, and PWA offline functionality adds complexity. Romanian language models may have limited availability or quality.",
      "yellow": "This creates a complete, production-ready language learning system that's actually usable for the intended Moldova trip. The local-first approach means no subscription fees or privacy concerns. The existing curriculum is comprehensive and culturally authentic. Modern web technologies make the UI/UX smooth and responsive. The project has clear, achievable scope with existing resources.",
      "green": "Could use existing libraries like React Query for state management, Tailwind for rapid UI development, better-sqlite3 for robust database operations, and Socket.io for real-time sync. Consider using Vite for fast development builds, Zustand for simple state management, and existing UI component libraries like Headless UI. Could implement spaced repetition algorithms for flashcards.",
      "blue": "Focus on core functionality first: basic Electron app, database setup, unit progression, and chat interface. Then add LLM integration, followed by PWA features and synchronization. Use incremental development with working prototypes at each stage. Prioritize existing libraries over custom implementations. Test on actual devices throughout development to ensure real-world usability."

The application will feature a Duolingo-style unit progression system with 30 units, each requiring completion before advancing. Implement a chat interface for LLM interaction using Language Transfer methodology, with automatic LM Studio integration and startup. Create responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile with PWA capabilities. Include comprehensive progress tracking, flashcard system with spaced repetition, and cultural context integration. Focus on production-ready code with no placeholders, using existing libraries wherever possible to minimize custom implementations."
