Some concern about maintaining focus and consistency across 110 listings.",

Use screenshots for authenticity verification and CSV format optimization for Google Sheets compatibility.\n\n**Risk Mitigation**: Handle anti-scraping measures through natural browsing patterns, verify business operational status through multiple indicators, and maintain data consistency through systematic templates and review cycles."
