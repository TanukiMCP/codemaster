Current wp-mcp capabilities are 25% ready - site verification and basic WordPress operations work, but theme/plugin management are placeholder implementations. We have admin access to clarksvillewedding.com with credentials in .env file, and can use hybrid manual/automated approach.",
      "red": "There's frustration that many wp-mcp functions are placeholders, but excitement about the structured approach and clear documentation. The hybrid manual/automated strategy feels pragmatic rather than ideal, but there's confidence that validation steps will provide good feedback. The end goal of a fully automated EventPros directory is motivating.",
      "black": "Major risks include: wp-mcp theme/plugin installation functions are non-functional placeholders, manual steps could introduce configuration errors, GeoDirectory plugin dependencies might conflict, backup functionality is missing so changes could be irreversible, and manual intervention breaks the automation goal. Time estimates might be optimistic if complications arise during manual setup.",
      "yellow": "The hybrid approach is actually practical and will work - we can validate each step with working wp-mcp functions. Manual setup ensures proper configuration that might be missed by automation. This approach builds confidence in the system incrementally. The clear success criteria and validation steps provide good checkpoints. Once setup is complete, subsequent phases can be more automated.",
      "green": "Alternative approaches: Use browser automation to perform manual steps programmatically, implement missing wp-mcp functions on-the-fly, use WP-CLI integration instead of REST API for some operations, create configuration templates that can be reused for other sites, or build a setup verification dashboard using the working wp-mcp functions.",
      "blue": "Strategy: Execute in three phases - A.1 Manual Setup (theme/plugins), A.2 WP-MCP Validation (verify everything works), A.3 Documentation (record successful configuration). Use working wp-mcp functions to validate each step. Maintain clear rollback points. Document any configuration details needed for future automation improvements."

    "denoised_plan": "**EventPros Phase A Execution Plan: Hybrid Manual/Automated WordPress Setup**\n\n**CORE STRATEGY**: Execute a three-phase hybrid approach that leverages working wp-mcp capabilities for validation while using manual intervention for non-functional placeholder operations.\n\n**PHASE A.1 - INITIAL VALIDATION & BASELINE (15 min)**\n- Use wp-mcp to establish current WordPress state baseline\n- Validate site health, authentication, and existing configuration\n- Document current plugin/theme status before changes\n\n**PHASE A.2 - MANUAL ENVIRONMENT SETUP (45 min)**  \n- Manual Divi theme installation and activation via WordPress admin\n- Manual installation of 6 GeoDirectory plugins with proper activation sequence\n- Manual basic WordPress configuration (permalinks, user registration, media settings)\n- Use browser automation where possible to reduce manual effort\n\n**PHASE A.3 - AUTOMATED VALIDATION & VERIFICATION (15 min)**\n- Use working wp-mcp functions to validate all setup components\n- Verify GeoDirectory post types and taxonomies are registered\n- Confirm site health shows no critical errors\n- Document successful configuration for future automation\n\n**KEY SUCCESS FACTORS**:\n1. Leverage working wp-mcp validation functions as checkpoints\n2. Maintain clear rollback points throughout manual setup\n3. Use browser automation to bridge manual steps where feasible\n4. Document every configuration detail for future automation enhancement\n\n**RISK MITIGATION**:\n- Validate each major step before proceeding to next\n- Take screenshots of configuration screens for rollback reference\n- Test functionality immediately after each plugin installation\n- Use wp-mcp health checks as go/no-go decision points\n\nThis approach ensures Phase A completion while building toward full automation in future iterations."
