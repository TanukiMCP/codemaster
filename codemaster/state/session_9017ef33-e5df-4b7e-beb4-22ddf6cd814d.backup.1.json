      "white": "Current state analysis: EventPros.com has a complete WordPress directory with Professional Blue (#2c5aa0) as primary color, secondary (#f39c12), and accent (#e74c3c). The site uses Divi theme with custom templates, GeoDirectory plugin for 276 business listings across 10 cities, and comprehensive wp-mcp handlers for automation. All core functionality is production-ready with modern Divi 5 integration.",
      "red": "User experience perspective: The current blue color scheme feels corporate but may lack the warmth and energy that event professionals need. Users likely want a more inviting, vibrant interface that reflects celebration and creativity. The existing UI might feel too utilitarian for an industry focused on memorable experiences and aesthetic appeal.",
      "black": "Risk analysis: Changing the color scheme could break existing Divi customizations and require extensive testing across all templates. There's risk of poor contrast ratios affecting accessibility, potential conflicts with the existing 276 business listings' display, and the complexity of updating colors across multiple components (templates, CSS, theme options, etc.) without breaking functionality.",
      "yellow": "Opportunity analysis: Modern color schemes can significantly improve user engagement and conversion rates. A fresh, contemporary palette will make EventPros stand out in the competitive directory market. We have powerful automation tools (wp-mcp) that can systematically update themes and content, plus the ability to test changes thoroughly before deployment.",
      "green": "Creative possibilities: We could implement trending color schemes like warm gradients, nature-inspired palettes, or event-industry specific colors (elegant purples, warm golds, or sophisticated greens). Consider modern design trends like dark mode options, improved typography contrast, or dynamic color adaptation based on content categories (different hues for planners vs caterers vs photographers).",
      "blue": "Strategic approach: First research modern directory and event industry color trends, then use sequential thinking to develop a systematic color update plan. Leverage wp-mcp tools to update theme configurations, test changes with Puppeteer for visual verification, and implement updates incrementally to minimize risk while maintaining the professional, trustworthy brand identity EventPros requires."
    },
    "denoised_plan": "Based on comprehensive analysis of current trends, research data, and EventPros' strategic objectives, I will implement a modern, warm color scheme transformation that moves away from the corporate blue (#2c5aa0) toward 2024-2025 event industry trends. The plan leverages Pantone's 2025 Color of the Year (Mocha Mousse) and warm earth tones to create a more inviting, celebration-focused brand identity while maintaining professional trustworthiness.\n\n**Strategic Direction**: Transform EventPros from \"corporate directory\" to \"warm, trustworthy celebration partner\" through:\n1. **Modern Color Psychology**: Implement warm, nature-inspired palette reflecting celebration and connection\n2. **Accessibility-First Design**: Ensure all color changes meet WCAG contrast requirements\n3. **Systematic Implementation**: Use wp-mcp tools to update themes, templates, and content systematically\n4. **Visual Testing**: Employ Puppeteer to capture before/after comparisons and verify changes\n5. **Brand Consistency**: Maintain EventPros' professional credibility while enhancing warmth and approachability\n\n**Color Strategy**: Replace cold Professional Blue with research-backed warm palette:\n- **Primary**: Sophisticated Teal/Forest Green (#2d5d2d or #4a7c59) - trustworthy yet warm\n- **Secondary**: Warm Mocha/Coffee Brown (#8b6f47) - aligned with Pantone 2025 trends  \n- **Accent**: Sophisticated Gold/Amber (#d4a474) - celebration and premium feel\n- **Supporting**: Warm grays and cream tones for balance and accessibility\n\nThis transformation will position EventPros as the premier, approachable directory for celebration professionals while maintaining business credibility."
