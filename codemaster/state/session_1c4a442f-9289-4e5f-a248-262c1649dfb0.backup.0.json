      "white": "Facts: GPT-4o has image generation capabilities through ChatGPT.com interface. Current pet bas relief application exists for 3D conversion. Challenge is generating faithful pet representations from client reference photos while avoiding uncanny valley effects. Need specific prompting strategies to process varied quality reference images and maintain pet likeness.",
      "red": "Emotional: Pet owners are deeply emotionally connected to their pets - faithful representation is crucial for customer satisfaction. Uncanny valley effects can be disturbing and disappointing. There's natural anxiety about whether AI can truly capture a beloved pet's unique personality and features. Success here creates strong emotional satisfaction.",
      "black": "Critical risks: AI image generation often lacks precise control over specific facial features and expressions. Uncanny valley is a persistent issue with AI-generated animals. GPT-4o might not maintain consistency across multiple generations. Client reference images will vary drastically in quality, lighting, angles, and poses, making standardized prompting difficult.",
      "yellow": "Benefits: GPT-4o is sophisticated and can understand detailed context and instructions. Proper prompting techniques can significantly improve output quality. Bas relief conversion process might actually help smooth out some uncanny valley artifacts. Can iterate and refine prompts based on results. Saves substantial time compared to manual artistic work while potentially achieving professional quality.",
      "green": "Creative alternatives: Develop multiple prompt strategies for different pet types (dogs, cats, birds, etc.). Use sequential prompting - first analyze the reference image, then generate based on analysis. Create prompt templates for various scenarios. Consider artistic styles that translate better to bas relief (like classical sculpture styles). Combine analysis prompts with generation prompts.",
      "blue": "Process strategy: Need systematic approach to develop and test prompts. Create workflow for processing client images through multiple prompt stages. Document successful prompt patterns for different pet types and scenarios. Establish quality assessment criteria. Build iterative refinement process based on bas relief conversion results."

This creates a detailed textual description that captures the pet's essence.\n\n**Stage 2 - Style-Guided Generation:** Generate images using classical sculpture/relief art styles that naturally avoid uncanny valley issues. Focus on slightly idealized but faithful representations with clear, well-defined features suitable for 3D conversion.\n\n**Stage 3 - Bas Relief Optimization:** Generate final images specifically optimized for bas relief conversion - emphasizing contrast, clear feature definition, and appropriate lighting that will translate well to raised sculptural forms.\n\n**Key Success Factors:**\n- Use pet breed expertise in prompts to ensure anatomical accuracy\n- Emphasize classical artistic styles that work well for sculptural conversion\n- Create pet-type-specific prompt templates (dogs, cats, etc.)\n- Build iterative refinement based on 3D conversion results\n- Maintain emotional connection through careful attention to unique pet characteristics\n\n**Quality Control:** Each stage builds on the previous, allowing for refinement and ensuring the final output maintains both faithful representation and optimal bas relief conversion properties."
