The design system exists in utils/designSystem.js but isn't consistently applied.",
      "red": "User frustration is clear - 'layout sucks', 'text is overlayed', 'broken' chat panel design. This feels like a broken, unprofessional interface that would drive users away. The single-panel approach feels restrictive and limiting for a development tool. The inconsistent UI patterns create confusion and cognitive load.",
      "black": "Risks include breaking existing functionality during refactor, potential performance issues with complex layouts, ensuring responsive design works across screen sizes, and maintaining backward compatibility with existing data/state. Time pressure could lead to rushed solutions. Complex nested components might introduce new bugs.",

Consistent design system will enhance user experience. This refactor will establish a solid foundation for future features. Clean layout will make the app feel polished and reliable.",
      "green": "Alternative approaches: CSS Grid layout system, split-view containers with proper resizing, standardized panel components, consistent header/toolbar patterns, simplified state management for panels, and unified theme application. Could implement a panel management system with proper state persistence.",
      "blue": "Strategy: First implement proper multi-panel layout at App level, then standardize component styling and structure, consolidate duplicate layout logic, ensure responsive design, and thoroughly test resizing behavior. Focus on core layout first, then polish details. Work systematically from App.jsx down to individual components."

    "denoised_plan": "**COMPREHENSIVE UI AESTHETICS TRANSFORMATION PLAN**\n\n**Core Problem Analysis:**\nThe current UI suffers from a fundamental architectural flaw - it uses a single-panel switching system that forces users to choose only one view at a time. This creates a poor user experience for a development tool that should support multiple simultaneous workflows. Additional issues include inconsistent styling, text overlapping, broken chat panel design, and scattered layout logic.\n\n**Technical Foundation:**\nLeverage the existing UnifiedEditorPanel.jsx pattern which demonstrates proper multi-panel layout with 3:2 flex ratios and ResizablePanel integration. Extend this approach to the entire application level while maintaining all existing functionality and state management.\n\n**Implementation Strategy:**\n1. Transform App.jsx from single-panel switching to proper multi-panel layout\n2. Standardize all UI components using the established design system\n3. Implement consistent panel headers and controls\n4. Clean up styling conflicts and overlapping elements\n5. Ensure responsive design and smooth interactions\n6. Polish all visual details to professional standards\n\n**Key Requirements:**\n- No terminal commands, testing, or documentation (focus purely on UI implementation)\n- Maintain all existing functionality while improving layout\n- Zero placeholders or incomplete elements in final result\n- 100% polished and production-ready appearance\n- Proper responsive behavior across screen sizes"
