      "red": "FEELINGS: This is an exciting project that will genuinely help people learn Romanian! The Language Transfer methodology is proven effective. Concerned about LM Studio integration complexity and ensuring smooth user experience across devices. Excited about creating something that mimics successful apps like Duolingo but with conversational AI.",
      "black": "CAUTION: LM Studio integration might be complex - need to handle auto-startup, model loading, API communication. Cross-platform PWA sync could be challenging. Database schema needs careful design for progress tracking. Mobile responsive design requires extensive testing. Large codebase means careful architecture planning essential.",

Modern web technologies make responsive design achievable. SQLite is reliable for local storage. The teaching methodology is proven effective. Clear requirements make implementation straightforward.",
      "green": "CREATIVITY: Could implement spaced repetition algorithms for flashcards. Voice recognition for pronunciation practice. Gamification with achievement badges. Cultural context integration with photos/videos. Offline-first design with smart sync. Progressive lesson difficulty adjustment based on performance. Export progress for backup.",

Focus on MVP first, then enhance. Test continuously across target devices."

    "denoised_plan": "ROMANIAN LANGUAGE LEARNING APPLICATION - COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\nCORE ARCHITECTURE: Build a production-ready Electron application with React/TypeScript frontend, SQLite database for local storage, LM Studio integration for Romanian AI tutoring, and PWA capabilities for mobile/tablet access. The application will guide users through 30 structured Romanian learning units using Language Transfer methodology with conversational AI interaction.\n\nIMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY: Start with solid foundation (project setup, database, core UI) then build incrementally adding chat interface, LLM integration, unit progression system, responsive design, and finally PWA/sync capabilities. Each component will be fully functional before moving to the next.\n\nKEY COMPONENTS:\n1. Project Foundation - Electron + React + TypeScript setup with proper build configuration\n2. Database Layer - SQLite schema for user progress, conversations, unit tracking, and analytics\n3. Core UI Framework - Responsive design system with desktop/tablet/mobile layouts\n4. Chat Interface - Full CRUD chat functionality with message history and real-time updates\n5. LLM Integration - LM Studio API connection with auto-startup and Romanian model management\n6. Unit Progression - Duolingo-style unit unlocking with mandatory completion tracking\n7. Learning Engine - Integration of existing curriculum prompts with AI conversation flow\n8. PWA Implementation - Service worker, offline capabilities, mobile installation\n9. Cross-Device Sync - LAN discovery and progress synchronization between devices\n10. Production Polish - Error handling, performance optimization, user experience refinement\n\nTECHNICAL DECISIONS:\n- Electron with React/TypeScript for robust cross-platform desktop experience\n- SQLite with better-sqlite3 for reliable local data persistence\n- Tailwind CSS for responsive design system\n- Zustand for lightweight state management\n- Socket.io for real-time LAN communication\n- IndexedDB for mobile PWA storage\n- Service workers for offline-first PWA functionality\n\nSUCCESS CRITERIA: Fully functional application where users can progress through all 30 Romanian units, chat with AI tutor using Language Transfer methodology, track progress across devices, and access content offline on mobile devices."
