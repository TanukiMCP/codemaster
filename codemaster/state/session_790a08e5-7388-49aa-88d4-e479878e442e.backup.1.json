      "yellow": "Great opportunity to create innovative pet portrait solution. Depth estimation approach is more reliable than Stable Diffusion for 3D. Local processing ensures privacy. Modular architecture allows incremental development and testing.",
      "green": "Could add batch processing, cloud backup, material presets, tool path optimization, mobile companion app for photo capture, social sharing features, marketplace for designs, AR preview mode.",
      "blue": "Implementation strategy: 1) Project scaffolding, 2) Core Electron app, 3) Python AI integration, 4) LLM coordination, 5) 3D processing pipeline, 6) UI/UX implementation. Focus on core functionality first, then optimize."
