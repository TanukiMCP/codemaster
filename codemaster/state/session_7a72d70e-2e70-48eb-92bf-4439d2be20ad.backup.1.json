      "white": "Facts from code: Electron app loads dist/index.html. React root in src/renderer.js with Redux Persist. App.jsx exists in coverage but missing from src tree, implying build includes it but source not present (possible move/refactor). UI uses MUI, custom design system, Monaco editor, modular Chat components under src/components/chat. TitleBar and MenuBar implemented with IPC handlers wired in main.cjs. FileExplorer uses read-directory/open-folder-dialog IPC, handlers exist. Many components exist for VM sandbox, settings, dashboards. Several services throw 'not implemented' in mcpStoreService and related. Playwright UI tests target ChatPanel and general UI presence. Dist bundles include many panels. Global CSS standardizes tokens.",
      "red": "Risk that visible UI may be rich but some operations fake or disconnected (e.g., MCP tools not implemented). Missing source of App.jsx is worrying for maintainability. UX complexity may overwhelm new users.",
      "black": "Monolithic or very large components still present (CodeEditor 980 lines, many 600-1000 line components), risk of poor maintainability. Several services list 'not implemented' errors; some features are placeholders (analytics, DB tools). Potentially inconsistent state management between slices and local state. Accessibility likely partial. App shell (App.jsx) not found in src; risk of divergence.",
      "yellow": "Strong base: design tokens, consistent MUI theming, modular chat pieces, IPC wiring present for critical flows (open folder, read dir). Tests exist for visual behaviors. Dist shows broad feature surface to build upon.",
      "green": "Propose clear E2E flows: Workspace onboarding \u2192 Explorer \u2192 Editor \u2192 Chat/Agent \u2192 Sandbox VM tools \u2192 Review/Apply diffs with accept/reject overlay \u2192 Checkpointing. Implement tool-call cards with streaming progress. Integrate taskmaster as backstage planner. Use existing libraries for tree view, layout, split panes, and Monaco diff. Replace placeholder services with API-client adapters guarded by feature flags. Introduce router-less view state or minimal router. Accessibility pass and keyboard map.",
      "blue": "Deliverables: design.txt with ASCII flows, mapping of flows to components, gap list, and a granular tasklist grouped by epics with 'definition of done' for completeness. Ensure each UX flow has mapped UI modules and owner slices."
