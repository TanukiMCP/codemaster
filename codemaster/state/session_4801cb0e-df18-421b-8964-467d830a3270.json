        "generated_content": "## Plugin API Research Summary\n\nI have completed the initial research phase for integrating WooCommerce, Hivepress, and Mailpoet into the `wp-mcp` server. Here is a summary of the findings and the proposed integration strategy for each plugin.\n\n### 1. WooCommerce\n\n*   **API Availability**: **Excellent**. WooCommerce provides a comprehensive and well-documented REST API (v3 is the latest).\n*   **Key Endpoints**: The API exposes endpoints for all critical resources, including Products, Orders, Customers, Coupons, and Reports.\n*   **Authentication**: Standard WordPress REST API authentication using API keys over HTTPS.\n*   **Integration Strategy**: This will be a straightforward REST API integration. I will create a new set of namespaced commands (e.g., `woocommerce:list_products`) within the `wp-mcp` tool. Each command will map to a specific REST API endpoint. The implementation will involve making HTTP requests to these endpoints and parsing the JSON responses.\n\n### 2. Hivepress\n\n*   **API Availability**: **None**. Hivepress does not offer a public REST API for integration.\n*   **Integration Method**: Integration must be done via its extensive system of WordPress **actions and filters**. The official documentation provides a detailed `Hook Reference`.\n*   **Key Hooks**: I will need to leverage hooks such as `hivepress/v1/models/listing/update` and filters like `hivepress/v1/forms/listing_search` to interact with the plugin's data.\n*   **Integration Strategy**: This will be a more complex, code-level integration. I will create a new handler in the `wp-mcp` server that contains custom PHP functions. These functions will use the Hivepress hooks to perform actions. For example, a `hivepress:create_listing` command would trigger a PHP function that calls `hivepress()->listing->insert( $args )`. This approach encapsulates the hook-based logic, exposing it as simple commands to the LLM.\n\n### 3. Mailpoet\n\n*   **API Availability**: **PHP API**. Mailpoet provides a dedicated PHP `\\MailPoet\\API\\API` class for developers.\n*   **Integration Method**: Direct interaction with the PHP API class within the WordPress environment.\n*   **Key Functionality**: The API class provides methods for managing subscribers and lists, such as `addSubscriber`, `getLists`, and `getSubscribers`.\n*   **Integration Strategy**: Similar to Hivepress, this will be a code-level integration. I will create a `handle_mailpoet_command` function that instantiates and uses the `\\MailPoet\\API\\API` class. Namespaced commands like `mailpoet:add_subscriber` will be exposed through the `wp-mcp` tool, which will call the corresponding methods in the handler.\n\n### Overall Plan\n\nThe research is complete and has provided a clear path forward for all three plugins. The next step is to proceed with the `design_architecture` task to formalize the namespaced command structure and the plugin handler dispatch system within the `wp_mcp` server.",
