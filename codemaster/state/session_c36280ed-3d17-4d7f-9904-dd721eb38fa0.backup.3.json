      "white": "Factual Analysis: Tanuki-AIDE is an Electron-based AI development environment with React frontend and Express backend. Current state shows extensive mock/placeholder code across services (visionAnalysisService, deepResearchService, taskmasterIntegrationService), a recently refactored ChatPanel from 1,316 lines to modular components, incomplete Plan/Act mode implementation, poor tool call visualization, and lack of proper state management. The application has comprehensive VM sandbox architecture, cloud VM rental system, and MCP tool integration. Dependencies include Material-UI, Monaco Editor, Framer Motion, and extensive testing infrastructure with Playwright.",
      "red": "Emotional/Intuitive Analysis: This feels like a project that got overwhelmed by AI-generated complexity rather than focusing on core user value. The extensive mock code suggests premature feature expansion without solid foundations. Users would be frustrated by 'undefined' results, poor visual feedback, and non-functional planning modes. However, the core vision of a Cursor-like AI development environment is genuinely exciting and valuable. The recent UI/UX cleanup shows positive momentum, and the comprehensive architecture documents indicate someone cares deeply about quality.",
      "black": "Critical Analysis: Major risks include massive technical debt from mock implementations, over-engineered custom solutions instead of proven libraries, performance bottlenecks from monolithic patterns, incomplete core features masquerading as complete functionality, and potential user abandonment due to poor UX. The complex architecture may be too ambitious for effective maintenance. Security concerns exist with VM execution and tool calling. The extensive feature scope could prevent ever reaching a truly usable v1.0.",
      "yellow": "Optimistic Analysis: The comprehensive architecture shows solid planning and the recent UI/UX refactoring demonstrates capability for systematic improvement. The modular service layer provides good separation of concerns for gradual enhancement. The extensive testing infrastructure shows commitment to quality. Market opportunity is excellent with AI development environments being highly valuable. The VM sandbox and cloud integration could provide significant competitive advantages. The foundation exists to build something truly exceptional.",
      "green": "Creative Analysis: Replace mock implementations with proven libraries - use existing web search APIs instead of simulated results, implement real MCP tool integrations, leverage established state management patterns (Redux Toolkit), and utilize component libraries for complex UI elements. Consider adopting established AI chat patterns from successful tools. Implement progressive enhancement - start with core chat + tool calling, then add planning, then VM features. Use feature flags to manage complexity. Consider plugin architecture for extensibility.",
      "blue": "Process Analysis: Implement a three-phase remediation strategy: Phase 1 - Core Foundation (eliminate mock code, implement real tool calling, fix UI/UX issues), Phase 2 - Advanced Features (proper Plan/Act mode, taskmaster integration, performance optimization), Phase 3 - Polish & Scale (comprehensive testing, documentation, performance monitoring). Use weekly sprints with clear deliverables, maintain backward compatibility through feature flags, and implement continuous user testing to validate improvements. Prioritize user-facing issues over internal architecture perfection."
