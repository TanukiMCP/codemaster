Target user is visiting Moldova in a few months. Each prompt must include learning objectives, vocabulary (15-20 words), grammar focus, practice activities, conversation scenarios, success criteria, and assessment instructions. Files should be named unit_##_description.txt in a 'prompts' folder. Focus is on practical conversation over academic learning.",
      "red": "Emotional motivation: The user is genuinely excited about visiting Moldova and wants to connect authentically with people there. They're frustrated with traditional textbook approaches and crave real conversational ability. There's enthusiasm for learning but also anxiety about being understood. They need confidence-building materials that feel practical and immediately useful. The emotional goal is feeling comfortable at social events like weddings and with friends.",
      "black": "Potential risks: Creating prompts that are too academic defeats the purpose. AI tutors might not properly assess conversational fluency. The progression might be too steep or too shallow. Moldova-specific cultural context might be insufficient. Success criteria could be too vague or too rigid. Students might get overwhelmed by 30 units. Grammar focus might overshadow conversation practice. Assessment methods might not translate well to AI tutoring.",
      "yellow": "Positive outcomes: This structured approach will systematically build genuine conversational fluency. The progressive nature ensures solid foundation before advancing. Focus on practical scenarios will immediately transfer to real-world use in Moldova. Clear success criteria will build confidence through measurable progress. AI tutoring format allows flexible pacing and unlimited practice. Cultural context will enhance social integration in Moldova.",
      "green": "Creative alternatives: Could incorporate Moldova-specific role-play scenarios like market haggling or wedding conversations. Include pronunciation guides using phonetic spelling. Add cultural immersion elements like traditional sayings or local expressions. Create branching conversations for different social contexts. Include 'survival phrases' for emergencies. Design interactive assessment games rather than formal tests.",
      "blue": "Process organization: Create prompts systematically by phase, ensuring each builds on previous learning. Establish consistent template structure for all 30 units. Implement quality checks for progression difficulty and cultural accuracy. Test sample prompts for effectiveness. Create clear file organization system. Ensure each prompt provides complete guidance for AI tutoring session with measurable outcomes."

    "denoised_plan": "Create 30 progressive Romanian language learning prompts designed for AI tutoring, targeting A2-B1 conversational fluency for someone visiting Moldova. The plan prioritizes practical conversation skills over academic learning, with Moldova-specific cultural context throughout. Each prompt will guide an AI tutor through a complete lesson with clear success criteria focused on observable conversational behaviors rather than theoretical knowledge.\n\nThe 30 units are organized in 6 phases of 5 units each, with careful progression from basic greetings to complex social interactions like wedding conversations. Each prompt follows a consistent template including: unit overview with learning objectives, Moldova-specific cultural context, core vocabulary (15-20 words with pronunciation guides), focused grammar concepts (1-2 per unit), progressive practice activities, real-world conversation scenarios, specific behavioral success criteria, detailed AI assessment instructions, encouragement phrases, and smooth transitions to next units.\n\nKey design principles: conversation-first approach, immediate practical application, confidence-building through measurable progress, flexibility for AI tutoring, cultural immersion elements, and emergency \"survival phrases\" integration. The prompts will explicitly instruct AI tutors to prioritize communication over perfect grammar initially, use patience and encouragement, and not advance students until mastery criteria are demonstrated through actual conversation practice rather than rote exercises."
