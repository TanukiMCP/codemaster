      "red": "User frustration is evident - they specifically demanded 'No placeholders, no fake code/logic/data, etc.' This indicates previous disappointment with incomplete implementations. There's urgency to deliver a fully functional system that actually works rather than just appears to work. The emotional stakes are high for delivering real value.",
      "black": "Major risks include: 1) WordPress REST API limitations for theme/plugin management, 2) Many operations require admin panel access that REST API doesn't provide, 3) WP-CLI dependency may not be available in all environments, 4) Complex integrations like GeoDirectory may have specific API requirements, 5) Time constraints for implementing dozens of incomplete functions, 6) Potential authentication/permission issues with advanced operations.",

Benefits include: 1) Existing foundation is solid with good architecture, 2) Real WordPress site available for testing, 3) Clear user requirements and existing project structure, 4) Potential to replace manual WordPress admin tasks with API automation, 5) EventPros use case provides concrete implementation target, 6) Can demonstrate real business value through directory site automation.",
      "green": "Creative approaches: 1) Implement hybrid solutions that combine REST API with direct database queries where needed, 2) Create intelligent fallbacks that guide users when REST API limitations exist, 3) Develop custom WordPress plugins to extend REST API capabilities, 4) Use combination of wp-mcp + direct file manipulation for advanced features, 5) Build progressive enhancement where basic features work via REST API and advanced features require additional setup, 6) Create automated setup scripts that configure WordPress for maximum API compatibility.",
      "blue": "Process strategy: 1) First audit all existing handlers to categorize as complete/incomplete/placeholder, 2) Prioritize core functionality that can be fully implemented via REST API, 3) Identify functions requiring WordPress admin access and create proper error handling with actionable guidance, 4) Implement missing functionality in order of dependency (auth -> basic CRUD -> advanced features), 5) Test each implementation against live WordPress site, 6) Focus on EventPros use case as validation of complete workflow, 7) Document limitations and workarounds clearly."

Document specific gaps and REST API limitations.\n\nPHASE 2: CORE FUNCTIONALITY COMPLETION\nImplement missing functionality for handlers that CAN be fully completed via WordPress REST API:\n- Fix WooCommerce integration with proper authentication\n- Complete Divi theme integration with real shortcode handling  \n- Implement functional GeoDirectory operations via custom endpoints\n- Add proper error handling and validation throughout\n\nPHASE 3: HYBRID SOLUTIONS FOR LIMITED OPERATIONS\nFor operations blocked by REST API limitations (theme/plugin installation), implement intelligent hybrid approaches:\n- Create comprehensive manual instruction generators\n- Develop WP-CLI integration where available\n- Build custom WordPress plugin to extend REST API capabilities\n- Implement progressive enhancement patterns\n\nPHASE 4: EVENTPROS WORKFLOW VALIDATION\nUse EventPros directory setup as comprehensive test case:\n- Complete environment setup automation\n- Implement custom post type creation\n- Build CSV import functionality for real data\n- Create functional Divi template system\n- Test end-to-end workflow with live WordPress site\n\nPHASE 5: QUALITY ASSURANCE & DOCUMENTATION\nTest all implementations against live WordPress site, document limitations clearly, and ensure no placeholder code remains. Focus on delivering real business value through working automation."
