The workspace is currently empty, requiring full project scaffold from package.json to deployment config.",
      "red": "This project has incredible potential to democratize AI-powered creative tools for makers and small businesses. The excitement comes from bridging cutting-edge AI with practical manufacturing outputs. However, there's anxiety about the complexity - integrating 4 different ecosystems (Electron, React, Python AI, Ollama) with zero tolerance for placeholders. The user will be frustrated if any component is non-functional.",
      "black": "Major risks include: Ollama models may not be available or properly configured, Python subprocess management is notoriously fragile on Windows, the AI processing pipeline could be too slow for real-time use, memory usage could spiral with large images and multiple AI models, and the complex dependency chain (OpenCV, Sharp, Three.js, Potrace) may have compatibility issues. File I/O for binary formats like STL could introduce corruption bugs.",
      "yellow": "Success means creating a revolutionary tool that transforms pet photos into physical art pieces via laser/CNC. The modular architecture will be highly maintainable, the Ant Design UI will be professional and intuitive, and the complete AI pipeline will demonstrate state-of-the-art local model integration. This could become a flagship example of desktop AI applications and spawn an entire ecosystem of similar tools.",
      "green": "Alternative approaches: Could use WebAssembly for image processing instead of Python subprocesses, implement progressive enhancement starting with basic functionality, use Electron's worker threads for AI processing, create a plugin architecture for different AI models, or implement a headless mode for batch processing. Could also add features like style transfer templates, collaborative editing, or cloud backup integration.",
      "blue": "Strategy: Start with core infrastructure (package.json, TypeScript config, basic Electron setup), then build the main process services (Ollama, Python bridge, image processing), followed by React components using Ant Design, and finally integration testing with real AI models. Use parallel development where possible, implement comprehensive error handling throughout, and maintain strict TypeScript typing. Test with real images and AI models at each stage."
