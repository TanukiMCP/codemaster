Research Moldovan Romanian expressions and Ungheni-specific cultural elements to ensure authentic regional awareness. Create a standardized CSV template that ensures Quizlet compatibility while accommodating comprehensive content including pronunciation guides, cultural context, and progressive difficulty levels.\n\nPhase 2 - Systematic Content Creation (Tasks 4-6):\nProcess units in three logical groups: Units 1-10 (Foundation - basic greetings to daily activities), Units 11-20 (Intermediate - complex conversations and past tense), and Units 21-30 (Advanced - cultural discussions and B1 fluency). Each flashcard set will include vocabulary, phrases, cultural expressions, grammar examples, and regional Moldovan variations. Content will be organized thematically within each unit to support natural learning progression.\n\nPhase 3 - Quality Assurance & Enhancement (Tasks 7-8):\nImplement comprehensive quality control including CSV formatting verification, cultural authenticity review, and progressive difficulty validation. Enhance flashcard sets with pronunciation hints, cultural context clues, and practical usage scenarios specific to living in Ungheni. Ensure each unit builds appropriately on previous knowledge while introducing new concepts at sustainable pace toward A2-B1 conversational fluency."
