      "white": "Factual analysis: The WordPress MCP server exists with 80% complete infrastructure including authentication, REST API integration, and WP-CLI support. Basic implementations exist for 8 handler functions (geodir location hierarchy, listing creation, CPT creation, categories, CSV import, Divi templates, theme setup, SEO optimization) but they need upgrading to production specifications. The implementation_prompt.md provides complete, production-ready code for all handlers. We have 276 business listings in CSV format across 10 cities for EventPros.com directory site. Target location is line ~3700 in wordpress_mcp_server.py before COMMAND_HANDLERS registration.",
      "red": "Emotional/intuitive analysis: This feels like a critical transition from prototype to production-ready system. There's excitement about having comprehensive specifications that eliminate guesswork, but concern about maintaining consistency with existing patterns. The user's emphasis on NO placeholders and production quality suggests frustration with incomplete implementations. This is the make-or-break moment for EventPros.com going live successfully.",
      "black": "Critical analysis: Risk of breaking existing functionality during upgrades. The current handlers may have dependencies or integrations not visible in isolated code review. WordPress plugin availability (GeoDirectory, Divi) could cause runtime failures. Large code replacements increase chance of syntax errors or missing imports. User's strict requirement for zero incomplete code means any oversight becomes a blocker. Integration with existing authentication and error handling patterns must be preserved.",
      "yellow": "Optimistic analysis: Having complete production specifications eliminates uncertainty and reduces development time. The existing infrastructure provides solid foundation with authentication, error handling, and WordPress integration already working. Sequential thinking and Context7 tools will ensure thoroughness and accuracy. Each handler is self-contained, allowing systematic implementation. EventPros.com will have enterprise-grade directory functionality supporting 276 listings across multiple cities.",
      "green": "Creative analysis: Could implement handlers incrementally with fallback to existing versions during transition. Use sequential thinking to validate each implementation against existing patterns. Context7 can provide WordPress/GeoDirectory documentation for verification. Could create validation tests by comparing input/output with existing handlers. Implement comprehensive error handling that gracefully degrades when plugins unavailable.",
      "blue": "Process analysis: Strategy: Replace existing basic handlers with production implementations one by one, ensuring each maintains existing integration patterns. Use sequential thinking for each handler to verify completeness and Context7 for WordPress/plugin documentation verification. Test each replacement against existing authentication and error handling. Maintain consistent async patterns and return formats. Implement in logical dependency order: GeoDirectory foundation first, then CSV import, then Divi templates, finally SEO optimization."
