    "denoised_plan": "# wp-mcp Critical Gap Implementation Plan\n\n## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nTransform wp-mcp from 30% to 90%+ production ready by implementing real WordPress infrastructure automation via WP-CLI integration, focusing on plugin/theme management and configuration automation. Use EventPros project as validation vehicle for 1-day automated directory site creation.\n\n## CORE STRATEGY\n**Foundation-First Approach**: Leverage the existing 95% ready content management system and add the missing 70% through strategic WP-CLI integration, comprehensive error handling, and security-first design patterns.\n\n## PRIORITY IMPLEMENTATION ORDER\n\n### Phase 1: WP-CLI Infrastructure Foundation (Critical Path)\n**Objective**: Replace placeholder plugin/theme handlers with real WP-CLI-based implementations\n**Impact**: Unlocks 50% of remaining production readiness\n**Components**:\n- Secure WP-CLI subprocess wrapper with comprehensive error handling\n- Plugin installation/activation with dependency management\n- Theme installation/activation with conflict detection\n- WordPress options management via wp-cli option commands\n- Backup/rollback capability before major changes\n\n### Phase 2: EventPros-Specific Automation (Validation)\n**Objective**: Implement specific workflows needed for EventPros automated delivery\n**Impact**: Validates real-world usage and completes remaining 20% readiness\n**Components**:\n- Divi theme installation and child theme creation automation\n- GeoDirectory plugin suite (6 plugins) installation with proper sequencing\n- WordPress configuration automation (permalinks, user registration, etc.)\n- Location hierarchy creation and content seeding integration\n\n### Phase 3: Production Hardening (Quality Assurance)\n**Objective**: Ensure reliability across different WordPress environments\n**Impact**: Achieves enterprise-grade 90%+ production readiness\n**Components**:\n- Comprehensive testing suite across hosting environments\n- Enhanced security measures and permission validation\n- Performance optimization and timeout handling\n- Complete documentation and error recovery procedures\n\n## RISK MITIGATION STRATEGY\n\n### Security First\n- All WP-CLI commands executed with proper sanitization and validation\n- User permission verification before destructive operations\n- Backup creation before major changes with automatic rollback on failure\n- Subprocess execution with restricted permissions and timeout limits\n\n### Error Recovery\n- Transactional approach: either complete success or full rollback\n- Detailed logging for debugging failed operations\n- Graceful degradation when WP-CLI unavailable (fallback to manual instructions)\n- Progress tracking for long operations with user feedback\n\n### Environment Compatibility\n- WP-CLI availability detection with clear error messages\n- WordPress version compatibility checking\n- Hosting provider capability validation\n- Alternative implementation paths for restricted environments\n\n## SUCCESS METRICS\n\n### Technical Metrics\n- Plugin installation success rate >95%\n- Theme activation without conflicts >90% \n- WordPress configuration automation completion >95%\n- Average setup time reduced from 4+ hours to <30 minutes\n\n### Business Metrics\n- EventPros project delivered in 1-2 days as planned\n- wp-mcp positioned as production-ready WordPress automation platform\n- Foundation established for scaling to multiple directory projects\n- Enterprise-grade reliability demonstrated through comprehensive testing\n\n## IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH\n\n### Smart Development\n- Start with highest-impact implementations (plugin/theme management)\n- Use EventPros requirements to drive development priorities\n- Build reusable patterns for future directory automation projects\n- Implement dry-run capabilities for safe testing and validation\n\n### Quality Focus\n- Test-driven development with comprehensive error scenarios\n- Real-world validation through EventPros implementation\n- Documentation-first approach for maintainability\n- Security review for all subprocess execution patterns\n\n## TIMELINE CONFIDENCE\nBased on analysis: **HIGH CONFIDENCE** for 2-3 week implementation timeline\n- Foundation already solid (95% content management ready)\n- WP-CLI patterns are well-established industry standard\n- Clear requirements from EventPros project specifications\n- Risk mitigation strategies address major potential issues\n- Creative solutions available for environment limitations\n\nThis plan transforms wp-mcp into a premier WordPress automation platform while delivering immediate value through EventPros project completion."
