      "white": "FACTS: WordPress MCP server for EventPros.com is 80% complete. Missing implementations include: 7 GeoDirectory functions, 1 CSV import function, 2 Divi theme functions, 1 SEO function, and 2 EventPros automation functions. Codebase has 3844 lines with existing auth, REST API, WP-CLI integration. Data ready: 276 business listings in CSV format across 10 cities. Target is production deployment on clarksvillewedding.com before DNS transfer. Existing handlers are in COMMAND_HANDLERS dict starting at line 3717.",
      "red": "EMOTIONS/CONCERNS: This is a critical production implementation with real business impact. Concern about incomplete handlers potentially breaking existing functionality. Worry about meeting production quality standards without placeholders or mock implementations. Anxiety about proper error handling for all edge cases. Excitement about completing a comprehensive directory automation system.",
      "black": "RISKS/PROBLEMS: Existing handlers may have placeholder implementations that need complete replacement. Risk of breaking existing 80% functionality while implementing new features. GeoDirectory plugin may not be available, requiring fallback implementations. CSV import could fail with malformed data. Divi theme integration might conflict with existing themes. WP-CLI commands may fail on different environments. User permissions might block certain operations. WordPress REST API rate limiting could impact bulk operations.",
      "yellow": "BENEFITS/OPPORTUNITIES: Complete production-ready directory automation system. Streamlined EventPros.com deployment process. Reusable MCP server for other directory projects. Comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms. Integration with established WordPress ecosystem. Potential for scaling to multiple cities and business types.",
      "green": "CREATIVE SOLUTIONS: Use sequential thinking for complex implementation planning. Leverage Context7 for up-to-date WordPress and plugin documentation. Implement progressive enhancement - basic functionality first, then advanced features. Create modular handlers that can work independently. Use comprehensive error handling with helpful user guidance. Implement validation at multiple levels.",
      "blue": "PROCESS/CONTROL: Use taskmaster for systematic task execution. Break implementation into logical phases: 1) Analyze existing code, 2) Complete GeoDirectory handlers, 3) Implement CSV import, 4) Build Divi automation, 5) Add SEO optimization, 6) Test integration. Ensure each task includes production-quality standards. Use parallel execution where possible. Maintain comprehensive documentation."
