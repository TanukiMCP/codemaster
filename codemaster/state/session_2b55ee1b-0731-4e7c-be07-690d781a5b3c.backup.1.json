The application has a solid foundation with React/Electron frontend, FastAPI backend, and sophisticated AI/ML integration. The project requires focused completion of remaining core functionality, testing, and deployment readiness.\n\n**Strategic Approach:**\n1. **Core Functionality Completion** - Ensure all critical workflows from photo upload to STL generation are fully functional\n2. **Integration Testing** - Validate the complete pipeline including LM Studio integration, Stable Diffusion processing, and STL generation\n3. **Build System Validation** - Ensure the optimized build process works correctly across platforms\n4. **Final Quality Assurance** - Comprehensive testing of the complete workflow and user experience\n\n**Key Technical Priorities:**\n- Complete any missing service integrations (LM Studio, ControlNet, STL generation)\n- Ensure robust error handling and recovery mechanisms\n- Validate hardware optimization for AMD RX 6600 target configuration\n- Test the complete build and packaging pipeline\n- Verify cross-platform compatibility\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- Complete photo-to-STL workflow functions reliably\n- Application builds and packages successfully\n- All core features work as documented\n- Performance meets RX 6600 optimization targets\n- User experience is smooth and intuitive"
