Multiple custom CSS/JS patches exist (pages 103-105) trying to fix basic design issues. Divi comes with 250+ free built-in layout packs including Event Organizer, Business Consultant, Marketing Agency layouts perfect for directory websites. GeoDirectory plugin handles business listings and search functionality.",
      "red": "User frustration is evident - they're experiencing poor design quality with contrast issues, spacing problems, and disproportionate text. The hodge-podge approach feels unprofessional and creates maintenance nightmares. There's excitement about the potential of using proven Divi design frameworks to create a cohesive, professional experience that reflects EventPros.com's quality standards. The goal is to achieve 'client would pay good money for' quality.",
      "black": "Major risks include disrupting existing functionality during redesign, potential conflicts between Divi layouts and GeoDirectory integration, and the complexity of systematically updating 50+ pages. Custom CSS patches suggest there may be underlying compatibility issues. Risk of breaking search functionality, user accounts, or business listing submissions. Time investment could be substantial for comprehensive redesign across all page types.",
      "yellow": "Huge opportunity to transform an inconsistent, patched website into a professional directory platform using proven design frameworks. Divi's built-in layouts are professionally designed, mobile-responsive, and regularly updated. This approach eliminates maintenance of custom CSS and creates design cohesion. EventPros.com will look like a premium directory service, improving user trust and engagement. Reduced development time for future updates since we'll be using standard Divi components.",
      "green": "Instead of page-by-page replacement, consider creating design templates for each page type (homepage, search, category, location, details) using the best Divi layouts as foundations. Mix and match sections from Event Organizer, Business Consultant, and Corporate layouts. Create a cohesive design system using Divi's global styles. Use Divi's Theme Builder for headers/footers to ensure consistency. Consider progressive enhancement - start with most critical pages first.",
      "blue": "Organize by page importance and user flow: 1) Homepage (first impression), 2) Search Results (core functionality), 3) Service Category pages (SEO landing pages), 4) Individual business details, 5) Location pages, 6) User management pages. Use wp-mcp to systematically update pages with professional Divi layouts. Test GeoDirectory integration at each step. Document the design system and layout choices for future reference. Measure success by design quality, user engagement, and reduced maintenance overhead."
