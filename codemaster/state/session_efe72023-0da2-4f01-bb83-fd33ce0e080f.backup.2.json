The codebase is 80% complete with solid infrastructure including authentication, REST API integration, WP-CLI, and error handling. We have 276 business listings across 10 cities in CSV format and detailed code specifications with complete examples.",
      "red": "There's clear urgency and frustration in the user's emphasis on 'no placeholders, no mock implementations, no broken functionality to chase down later.' This suggests past experiences with incomplete code. The project represents a significant milestone toward launching EventPros.com, and the user wants production-ready functionality that works immediately without debugging sessions.",
      "black": "Major risks include breaking the existing 80% complete infrastructure while adding new functions, WordPress plugin compatibility issues between GeoDirectory and Divi, complex error handling across multiple systems (REST API, WP-CLI, WordPress options), and the large scope of modifications to a single critical file. Integration complexity between different WordPress systems could introduce subtle bugs.",
      "yellow": "This implementation will complete the EventPros.com directory site with full automation capabilities, enabling immediate deployment of 276 business listings across 10 cities. The detailed specifications with complete code examples significantly reduce implementation risk. The solid existing foundation means we're building on proven infrastructure, and production-ready code eliminates technical debt.",

Could also create backup points and test each component independently before integration.",
      "blue": "Organize implementation by system domains: first examine existing codebase patterns, then implement GeoDirectory functions as a group (they depend on each other), followed by CSV import (depends on GeoDirectory), then Divi theme functions, SEO optimization, and finally command registration. Use sequential thinking for complex implementations and validate integration at each phase."
    },
    "denoised_plan": "The WordPress MCP server implementation requires a careful, phased approach to add 8 production-ready handler functions while preserving existing infrastructure. The strategy is to examine existing code patterns first, then implement functions in logical dependency order: GeoDirectory integration (4 functions), CSV import, Divi theme automation, SEO optimization, and command registration. Each implementation phase will use sequential thinking for complex logic, leverage Context7 for WordPress best practices, and validate against existing patterns to prevent breaking changes. The detailed specifications with complete code examples minimize implementation risk, but careful integration testing is essential given the complexity of WordPress plugin interactions. The end result will be a fully functional EventPros.com directory site capable of automating 276 business listings across 10 cities with no technical debt or incomplete functionality."
