Must use Puppeteer for direct browsing and screenshot collection from legitimate sources like Google My Business, Yelp, WeddingWire. Output must be clean CSV files compatible with Google Sheets with predefined data structures including contact info, specializations, pricing, and business details.",
      "red": "This project feels exciting because we're building something valuable with real, authentic business data rather than fake content. There's satisfaction in creating a legitimate professional directory that will genuinely help people find quality service providers. However, there's also some nervousness about ensuring we respect website terms of service and collect data ethically while being thorough and efficient.",
      "black": "Main risks include potential rate limiting or blocking from websites if we browse too aggressively, inconsistent data quality across different sources and cities, and the time-intensive nature of manually collecting 110 businesses. Some sites may have anti-scraping measures, and ensuring data accuracy while maintaining efficiency could be challenging. There's also risk of incomplete or outdated business information.",
      "yellow": "This will create a valuable, credible database that provides real value to users seeking professional services. Using authentic data from verified sources will establish trust and credibility for EventPros.com. The CSV format allows easy manipulation and import, and Puppeteer provides reliable automation. Multiple source validation will ensure comprehensive, accurate business information that competitors using fake data can't match.",
      "green": "Alternative approaches include starting with easier cities to establish efficient workflows, batching collection by business type for consistency, using different search strategies per region, and implementing cross-validation between multiple sources. Could also create progressive data collection where we verify and enhance initial findings through multiple source checks.",
      "blue": "Organize into 4 systematic tasks as requested: Event Planners, Caterers, Photographers, and final validation/CSV preparation. Establish consistent workflows for each business type, document all sources and validation methods, use city-by-city systematic approach, and maintain quality control throughout. Create reusable templates and processes for efficiency and consistency."

Organize work into 4 sequential tasks: (1) Event Planner collection targeting 50 businesses across 10 cities using Google My Business and WeddingWire, (2) Caterer collection targeting 30 businesses using Yelp and local directories, (3) Photographer collection targeting 30 businesses using professional photography networks, and (4) Data validation and CSV file creation for Google Sheets compatibility. Implement respectful browsing patterns with natural delays to avoid rate limiting, establish consistent data collection templates for each business type, and cross-validate information across multiple sources for accuracy. Prioritize data quality over speed, document all sources for compliance, and create structured CSV outputs with complete business information including contact details, specializations, pricing, and service areas. This approach balances efficiency with ethical data collection to create a valuable, credible business directory."
