Current wp-mcp has 2419 lines with solid authentication and content management but 70% of 'professional development' handlers return success messages without implementation. EventPros spec requires 6 GeoDirectory plugins, Divi theme setup, 110 listings across 10 cities, and complete UI automation.",
      "red": "Strong motivation to eliminate placeholders and deliver true production capability. Frustration with 'success message' implementations that don't actually work. Excitement about WordPress REST API capabilities and modern development practices. User clearly wants working automation, not conceptual frameworks. The '100% production quality' requirement shows serious intent for real-world usage.",
      "black": "Major risks include WordPress API limitations for plugin/theme installation, potential security issues with filesystem operations, version compatibility across WordPress installs, and complexity of GeoDirectory database integration. Plugin installation may require file upload mechanisms not available via REST API. Theme management could need direct filesystem access. WP-CLI dependency might create deployment complexity.",
      "yellow": "Implementing real functionality will make wp-mcp a genuinely valuable WordPress automation platform. Success will enable full EventPros execution and create reusable components for future directory projects. WordPress REST API is mature and well-documented. Context7 can provide current API information. Building on the solid foundation already established will create a powerful tool for WordPress developers.",
      "green": "Alternative implementation strategies: WordPress WP-CLI integration for advanced operations, direct WordPress API calls for plugin management, filesystem operations for theme handling, database operations for custom post types. Could also explore WordPress Multisite API, headless WordPress approaches, or containerized WordPress management. Modern async Python with proper error handling can create robust solutions.",
      "blue": "Organize by impact priority: Plugin management first (blocks everything), theme management second (enables UI), WordPress options third (completes basic automation), GeoDirectory integration fourth (directory-specific). Use Context7 for current WordPress documentation, implement with proper error handling and validation, test each component independently, then integrate systematically. Focus on EventPros requirements but build reusable components."

Focus on high-impact gaps first while maintaining the existing solid foundation.\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH**:\n1. **Plugin Management System**: Research WordPress.org API and WP-CLI for real plugin installation, activation, and configuration\n2. **Theme Management System**: Implement theme installation, activation, and child theme creation using WordPress APIs\n3. **WordPress Configuration API**: Build options management for permalinks, user settings, and media configuration\n4. **GeoDirectory Integration**: Replace config-only CPT creation with actual WordPress database operations\n5. **Production Quality**: Add comprehensive error handling, validation, and rollback mechanisms\n\n**TECHNICAL FOUNDATION**: Use Context7 for current WordPress documentation, leverage existing FastMCP architecture, implement async operations with proper timeouts, and create reusable components that extend beyond EventPros.\n\n**SUCCESS CRITERIA**: All identified placeholders replaced with functional implementations, EventPros specification fully executable via wp-mcp automation, comprehensive error handling and validation, and production-ready code quality throughout."
