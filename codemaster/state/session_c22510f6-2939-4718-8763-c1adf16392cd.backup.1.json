User wants to upload 3 pet photos (front, left, right side) to generate bas relief busts for CNC wood carving. Must integrate with Ollama for LLM processing. Current architecture has optimization services, ControlNet integration, and STL validation.",
      "red": "User feels overwhelmed by complexity and wants simplification. There's excitement about creating physical art from pet photos. The current system seems over-engineered for the specific use case. Users will want an intuitive, fast workflow from photo upload to CNC-ready file.",
      "black": "Major risks: Current codebase is overly complex with multiple abstraction layers. Stable Diffusion for bas relief generation is challenging - it's not designed for 3D depth maps. ControlNet depth estimation from single images may not provide accurate side profile information. Integration between Ollama LLM, Stable Diffusion, and mesh generation could be brittle.",
      "yellow": "Great opportunities: Simplifying to focus on single pet portraits will make the system much more reliable. Modern tools like ComfyUI workflows could streamline the process. Ollama integration allows for intelligent prompt enhancement and image analysis. CNC output provides tangible, valuable results that users will treasure.",
      "green": "Alternative approaches: Use depth estimation models specifically designed for portraits. Consider using photogrammetry techniques for 3D reconstruction from multiple angles. Could use specialized bas relief generation models or train a LoRA for pet portraits. Might simplify to a web-based tool instead of Electron app.",

Remove unnecessary optimization layers and focus on a working pipeline. Prioritize reliability over advanced features initially."

    "denoised_plan": "SIMPLIFIED PET BAS RELIEF GENERATOR - IMPLEMENTATION PLAN\n\nCORE PHILOSOPHY: Strip away unnecessary complexity and focus on a reliable pipeline from 3 pet photos to CNC-ready STL files.\n\nSIMPLIFIED ARCHITECTURE:\n1. Replace complex Electron app with streamlined web interface\n2. Use Ollama LLM for intelligent pet breed identification and prompt enhancement\n3. Implement depth estimation using specialized portrait models (not Stable Diffusion)\n4. Create direct mesh generation from depth maps to STL files\n5. Remove optimization layers, batch processing, and complex abstractions\n\nTECHNICAL APPROACH:\n- Use MiDaS or DPT depth estimation models for better portrait depth maps\n- Combine 3 views (front, left, right) using photogrammetry principles\n- Ollama processes pet photos to identify breed characteristics and generate descriptive prompts\n- Generate heightmaps suitable for bas relief carving (shallow depth, smooth transitions)\n- Direct STL generation without intermediate complex mesh processing\n\nWORKFLOW:\n1. User uploads 3 photos (front view, left profile, right profile)\n2. Ollama analyzes photos to identify pet breed, features, and generates enhancement prompts\n3. Depth estimation creates depth maps for each view\n4. Combine depth maps into unified 3D representation using weighted blending\n5. Generate bas relief heightmap with CNC-appropriate depth constraints\n6. Convert heightmap to STL mesh with proper scaling for wood carving\n7. Validate STL and provide download with carving recommendations\n\nFOCUS AREAS:\n- Reliability over advanced features\n- Clear error handling and user feedback\n- CNC-optimized output (proper tool paths, depth limits)\n- Simple, intuitive interface"
