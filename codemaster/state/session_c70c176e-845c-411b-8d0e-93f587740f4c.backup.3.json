Implement robust error handling, data validation, and anti-detection measures while respecting terms of service.\n\nEXECUTION STRATEGY:\n1. Establish scraping infrastructure with proper headers, delays, and user-agent rotation\n2. Create standardized data collection templates for each business type  \n3. Implement city-by-city systematic collection with cross-source validation\n4. Generate clean, normalized CSV files with consistent schemas ready for import\n5. Include data validation checks for completeness, accuracy, and authenticity\n6. Document sources and collection methods for compliance and future updates\n\nRISK MITIGATION: Use reasonable delays between requests, implement retry logic for failures, rotate user agents and headers, respect robots.txt, and focus on publicly available business directory data to minimize legal concerns while maximizing data quality.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS: Four CSV files (setup log, event_planners.csv, caterers.csv, photographers.csv) with complete business information including contact details, specializations, pricing ranges, service areas, and aggregated review data, all formatted for easy Google Sheets import and database integration."
