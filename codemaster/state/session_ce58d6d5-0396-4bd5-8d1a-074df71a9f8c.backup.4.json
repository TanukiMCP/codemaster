      "white": "The current UI has several critical issues: 1) CSS custom properties in global.css reference undefined variables (--text-primary, --background-default, etc.) that aren't set by Material-UI themes, causing styling failures. 2) Single-panel layout in App.jsx that only shows one component at a time instead of multi-panel IDE-like interface. 3) ChatPanel has overlapping complex features (planning panels, reasoning panels, overlays) creating layout conflicts. 4) Material-UI themes are properly defined but not integrated with global CSS. Backend integration appears functional but frontend styling is severely broken.",
      "red": "This is frustrating for users who expect a polished, modern IDE experience. The broken styling makes the app feel unprofessional and difficult to use. Users likely feel confused by the single-panel approach when they expect multiple resizable panels like in VSCode. The chaotic ChatPanel design probably creates anxiety about whether the app is functioning correctly. There's excitement potential here - fixing these issues could dramatically improve user satisfaction and make the app feel truly professional.",
      "black": "Major risks include: 1) Breaking existing functionality while refactoring the layout system. 2) CSS variable integration with Material-UI could introduce performance issues. 3) Multi-panel layout refactoring might break responsive design. 4) Complex ChatPanel cleanup could accidentally remove important features. 5) Time constraints - this is a substantial refactoring that could take significant effort. 6) Backend-frontend integration could be disrupted during layout changes. Need to be careful not to introduce new bugs while fixing aesthetics.",
      "yellow": "Massive opportunity to transform the user experience! Fixing the CSS system will immediately resolve text overlay and styling issues. Implementing a proper multi-panel layout will make this feel like a professional IDE. Cleaning up ChatPanel will create a much more intuitive and pleasant interface. This could be a major turning point for app usability. The existing Material-UI theme system provides a solid foundation to build upon. Backend integration is already working, so we can focus purely on presentation layer improvements.",
      "green": "Alternative approaches: 1) Create CSS-in-JS bridge to sync Material-UI theme with CSS custom properties. 2) Implement React-based panel system with drag-and-drop resizing using libraries like react-mosaic or react-split-pane. 3) Redesign ChatPanel as modular components with clear visual hierarchy. 4) Consider using CSS Grid for layout instead of Material-UI Grid. 5) Implement proper responsive breakpoint system. 6) Use React Suspense for better component loading states. 7) Consider implementing a design system component library for consistency.",
      "blue": "Strategy: 1) First fix CSS variable system by creating bridge between Material-UI themes and CSS custom properties. 2) Refactor App.jsx layout to multi-panel system with resizable panels. 3) Redesign ChatPanel with clear visual hierarchy and separated concerns. 4) Test at each step to ensure backend integration remains intact. 5) Implement responsive design considerations. 6) Focus on aesthetics and UX while explicitly avoiding terminal commands, testing, or documentation as specified. Use parallel development approach where possible to minimize sequential dependencies."
