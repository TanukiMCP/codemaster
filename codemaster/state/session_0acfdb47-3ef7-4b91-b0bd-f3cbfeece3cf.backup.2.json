Missing ControlNet models, background removal libraries, and advanced depth processing algorithms. Windows environment requires Python package management via pip.",

There's excitement about the proposed workflow (background removal \u2192 pose adjustment \u2192 depth mapping \u2192 STL) because it addresses the core problem. The emotional payoff will be huge when pets are properly isolated and repositioned into ideal poses for bas relief carving. Users want this to 'just work' without hunting down incomplete implementations.",
      "black": "Major risks include: ControlNet models are large (GB each) and may strain system resources. REMBG/SAM integration could conflict with existing AMD optimizations. Background removal quality varies significantly across different pet photos. Pose repositioning may not work well for all animal types. Integration complexity could break existing functionality. Model downloads and Python dependencies could fail on Windows systems.",

Background removal eliminates messy details that don't carve well. Enhanced depth estimation creates actual 3D relief instead of flat surfaces. This positions the app as a premium tool for woodworkers and pet owners. Success creates a complete, automated workflow that rivals expensive commercial software.",
      "green": "Creative approaches: Use multiple background removal techniques in sequence (REMBG + edge detection). Combine pose detection with manual refinement options. Implement progressive depth estimation using multiple algorithms. Create preset profiles for common pets (dogs, cats) with optimized parameters. Use AI to suggest optimal poses based on pet breed/size. Integrate depth-from-stereo techniques for enhanced 3D understanding.",
      "blue": "Implementation strategy: Start with core dependencies (REMBG, ControlNet extension installation). Build background removal module with fallback options. Implement pose detection and repositioning system. Enhance depth estimation with multiple techniques. Integrate everything into existing quick convert workflow. Test with various pet images. Ensure proper error handling and user feedback throughout the process. Maintain AMD optimization compatibility."
