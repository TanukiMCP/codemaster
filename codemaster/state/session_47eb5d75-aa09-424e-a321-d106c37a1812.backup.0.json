Technical stack: Node.js/Electron with image processing libraries. Target formats: STL, heightmap images, or G-code. User needs simple drag-and-drop interface with conversion parameters like depth, resolution, and smoothing controls.",
      "red": "Users will be excited about transforming personal photos into physical carved art pieces. There's emotional satisfaction in seeing 2D memories become 3D objects. However, users may feel frustrated if the conversion quality is poor or if the interface is too technical. The magic moment is when they see their image transformed into a usable CNC file.",

Format compatibility issues between different CNC software could cause user frustration. Getting proper depth mapping from 2D images is technically challenging and results may not always meet expectations.",

Could enable small businesses to offer custom bas relief services. The combination of modern web technologies with traditional woodworking creates exciting possibilities.",
      "green": "Alternative approaches: Use Canvas API for real-time preview, implement multiple conversion algorithms (gradient-based, edge-detection, AI-enhanced), add batch processing, include material-specific presets. Could integrate with online CNC services or add social sharing features. Consider using WebGL for 3D preview of the relief.",
      "blue": "Development strategy: Start with MVP - basic Electron app with simple image upload and basic heightmap generation. Use proven libraries for image processing. Implement iterative development with user testing at each stage. Focus on core conversion functionality first, then enhance UI and add advanced features. Ensure proper error handling and user feedback throughout."

    "denoised_plan": "Synthesized Implementation Plan: Create a professional Electron desktop application for converting images to bas relief heightmaps for CNC carving. The app will feature a clean, intuitive interface with drag-and-drop image upload, real-time preview, and adjustable conversion parameters. Use established libraries like Sharp for image processing and Canvas API for preview rendering. Implement grayscale-to-heightmap conversion with configurable depth, smoothing, and resolution settings. Export functionality will support multiple formats including PNG heightmaps and STL files compatible with Fusion360/Carveco. The architecture will prioritize performance with progress indicators for long operations, proper error handling, and memory management for large images. Development follows MVP approach: core functionality first, then UI enhancements and advanced features. The final product will democratize CNC art creation while maintaining professional quality output."
