      "white": "The EventPros spec requires a WordPress directory with Divi + GeoDirectory for 10 cities, 3 CPTs (Event Planners, Caterers, Photographers), 110 sample listings, and complete UI/UX templates. WP-MCP currently exists as a Model Context Protocol server for WordPress automation. Key files include wordpress_mcp_server.py, phase execution documents, and configuration files for eventpros and restaurant_directory projects. The spec demands 100% production quality with no placeholders, requiring analysis of current implementation depth and gaps.",
      "red": "There's excitement about leveraging MCP for WordPress automation, but concern about whether the current implementation is truly production-ready or still conceptual. The user's emphasis on 'no placeholders, no mock logic' suggests potential worry about incomplete implementations. The desire for detailed Claude prompts indicates they want to streamline execution and avoid trial-and-error. There's urgency in wanting to 'literally just go down the list of tasks' which suggests time pressure and need for efficiency.",
      "black": "Major risks include: wp-mcp may be early-stage with incomplete WordPress integration, potential gaps between MCP capabilities and complex WordPress operations like GeoDirectory setup, possible lack of Divi-specific automation, insufficient error handling for production environments. The complexity of location hierarchies, bulk importing 110 listings, and ensuring proper geocoding may exceed current automation capabilities. Integration between MCP server and Cursor AI workflow may have undiscovered limitations.",
      "yellow": "MCP provides powerful automation potential for repetitive WordPress tasks like bulk content creation, taxonomy setup, and plugin configuration. Having structured phase documents shows good planning foundation. The wp-mcp server could streamline the entire EventPros build process, making it repeatable for future directory projects. Success would create a valuable WordPress automation system that could handle complex directory builds efficiently. The structured approach with detailed prompts could make expert-level WordPress development accessible.",
      "green": "Alternative approaches could include: hybrid MCP + manual workflow for complex operations, creating specialized MCP tools for GeoDirectory operations, developing template-based prompt engineering for consistent results, building validation checkpoints throughout the process. Could also explore WordPress CLI integration, headless WordPress approaches, or containerized development environments. The MCP server could be extended with WordPress-specific modules for themes, plugins, and content management.",
      "blue": "The analysis should follow a systematic evaluation: 1) Examine current wp-mcp implementation depth, 2) Map EventPros requirements to MCP capabilities, 3) Identify production-readiness gaps, 4) Design enhancement roadmap, 5) Create detailed execution workflow with Claude prompts. Success metrics include complete automation coverage, error-free production deployment, and reusable methodology. The process should prioritize critical path items and ensure each phase builds properly on the previous one."
