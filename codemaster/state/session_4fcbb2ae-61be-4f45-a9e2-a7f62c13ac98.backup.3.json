The remaining 5 tasks are: flashcard system with spaced repetition, PWA features, cross-device sync, settings management, and final testing. We have 30 CSV files with flashcard data ready for import, a complete SQLite database schema, and all necessary development tools.",
      "red": "There's excitement about completing this comprehensive language learning app that could genuinely help people moving to Moldova. The flashcard system feels like the most impactful missing piece - it's what many users expect in a language app. There's some concern about the complexity of implementing proper spaced repetition algorithms, but confidence in the existing solid foundation.",
      "black": "The main risks are: spaced repetition algorithm complexity could be time-consuming to implement correctly, CSV parsing might have encoding issues with Romanian characters, the UI needs to be intuitive for non-technical users, and integration with existing progress tracking needs careful coordination. There's also risk of feature creep if we try to implement too many advanced features.",
      "yellow": "Completing the flashcard system will make this a truly comprehensive language learning platform. The existing context management and progress tracking provide perfect foundation for intelligent flashcard scheduling. Users will have offline-capable, AI-enhanced Romanian learning with personalized difficulty adjustment. This could be a standout application in the language learning space.",
      "green": "We could implement a simple but effective spaced repetition algorithm (SM-2 or simplified version), create animated flip cards for engaging UX, integrate flashcard performance with the existing assessment engine, add gamification elements like streaks and achievements, or even use the AI to generate additional flashcards based on user weaknesses.",
      "blue": "The logical next step is implementing the flashcard system since it's the most user-facing missing feature. We should: 1) Create database schema for flashcard tracking, 2) Build CSV import system, 3) Design interactive flashcard UI components, 4) Implement spaced repetition algorithm, 5) Integrate with existing progress tracking. This approach builds on existing infrastructure while delivering immediate user value."

The implementation will leverage the existing solid foundation of database infrastructure, progress tracking, and context management to create an engaging and effective flashcard learning experience.\n\nThe plan focuses on implementing a complete flashcard system that integrates seamlessly with the existing architecture. We'll create a robust database schema for flashcard tracking, build a CSV import system to load the 30 existing flashcard sets, design interactive UI components with smooth flip animations, implement a proven spaced repetition algorithm (simplified SM-2), and integrate performance data with the existing assessment engine.\n\nKey technical considerations include handling Romanian character encoding properly during CSV import, ensuring the spaced repetition algorithm is simple but effective, creating an intuitive UI that works well for language learning, and maintaining consistency with the existing design system. The implementation will avoid feature creep by focusing on core functionality first, with potential enhancements like gamification and AI-generated cards as future iterations.\n\nThe flashcard system will track individual card performance, schedule reviews based on user success rates, integrate with the existing progress tracking for comprehensive learning analytics, and provide immediate user value by making the app feel complete and professional. This positions the app as a comprehensive language learning platform ready for real-world use."
