  "data": {
    "six_hat_analysis": {
      "white": "Facts: We have a WordPress staging site (clarksvillewedding.com) with DIVI theme and GeoDirectory plugin installed. The site currently has 20 pages including homepage, search results, service pages (event planners, caterers, photographers), city pages (Chicago, Miami, Seattle), and utility pages. DIVI provides access to 2000+ layouts across ~760 layout packs. GeoDirectory handles directory functionality. Current styling is inconsistent with some custom CSS implementations. Target is EventPros.com branding with #4a7c59 green color scheme.",
      "red": "Emotional/intuitive: This project feels exciting because it's about creating a truly professional, client-ready product. The current site has potential but lacks the cohesive, polished feel that would make clients want to pay for it. There's satisfaction in knowing we can transform a hodgepodge of styles into something that looks professionally designed. The directory concept is solid, but the execution needs to feel premium and trustworthy to attract both businesses wanting to list and customers seeking services.",
      "black": "Critical risks: DIVI layout API had errors when testing, which could complicate layout discovery and implementation. No single DIVI layout pack exists specifically for directories, requiring careful mix-and-match approach that could result in visual inconsistency. GeoDirectory integration with DIVI layouts may require custom CSS/modifications. Time-intensive process to redesign every page while maintaining functionality. Risk of breaking existing functionality during redesign. Need to ensure all GeoDirectory shortcodes and features work within new layouts.",
      "yellow": "Opportunities: DIVI's professional layout quality combined with GeoDirectory's functionality could create a truly premium directory website. The systematic approach ensures every user touchpoint is professionally designed. This could become a template/model for other directory projects. The cohesive design will significantly improve user experience and conversion rates. Professional appearance will help with business listings acquisition. Could demonstrate the power of combining DIVI + GeoDirectory for directory websites.",
      "green": "Creative approaches: Instead of finding one layout pack, identify 2-3 complementary packs that share design elements (colors, typography, button styles) and create a cohesive system. Use web search to find the most popular business/directory-friendly DIVI layout packs. Create a design system document to ensure consistency. Consider creating custom DIVI modules for GeoDirectory integration. Use the enhanced search results styling as a foundation and extend that professional approach to all pages.",
      "blue": "Process strategy: Start with comprehensive audit of all pages and user journeys. Research and select compatible DIVI layout pack(s) that work well for directory sites. Create systematic redesign plan prioritizing high-impact pages (homepage, search results) first. Test each implementation thoroughly to ensure GeoDirectory functionality remains intact. Document the design system for consistency. Use taskmaster to break down into specific, actionable tasks for each page type and user flow."
