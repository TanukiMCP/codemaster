      "white": "FACTS: RX 6600 8GB VRAM limits us to smaller models but sufficient for SD 1.5 + LoRA. 48GB RAM allows large batch processing. Need Electron + React frontend, Python FastAPI backend, integration with LM Studio REST API. Target: STL generation from pet photos via heightmap conversion. Must be 100% complete with no placeholders.",
      "red": "FEELINGS: Excited about the technical challenge. Concerned about model performance on RX 6600 - need to optimize carefully. Worried about complexity of heightmap-to-STL conversion quality. Confident that the architecture is sound and achievable.",
      "black": "CAUTION: RX 6600 may struggle with SDXL - stick to SD 1.5. Heightmap to mesh conversion can produce poor topology. STL files may not be watertight. Model fine-tuning for bas-relief is uncharted territory. Integration between multiple services could be fragile.",
      "yellow": "OPTIMISM: Modern SD models are very capable. Trimesh library handles mesh cleanup well. Electron provides excellent cross-platform deployment. LM Studio integration is straightforward. The modular architecture allows for easy debugging and iteration.",
      "green": "CREATIVITY: Use ControlNet Depth + Normal maps for better relief generation. Implement multi-scale heightmap processing. Add real-time preview during generation. Create custom LoRA training pipeline. Use CLIP embeddings for style consistency.",
      "blue": "PROCESS: Start with backend Python service, then Electron shell, then integration. Test each component independently. Use incremental development with working prototypes at each stage. Implement comprehensive error handling and fallbacks."
