Target platform is Windows 10, integrating with LM Studio for local LLM coordination. Must handle image processing, 3D mesh generation, and CNC-optimized output for BobsCNC machines.",
      "red": "This project feels exciting because it bridges AI, 3D modeling, and physical crafting - creating something tangible from pet photos. The user's enthusiasm for faithful representation suggests they want emotionally meaningful results. There's satisfaction in the complete pipeline from photo to carved relief.",
      "black": "Major risks include AI model integration complexity, Python-Node.js communication challenges, 3D processing performance issues, large file handling, and ensuring the depth estimation actually produces carve-worthy reliefs. Memory usage could be problematic with large images and 3D meshes.",
      "yellow": "Huge potential for creating unique, personalized pet memorials. The local processing ensures privacy, and the CNC integration makes it immediately practical. Success could lead to a valuable tool for woodworkers and pet owners. The modular architecture allows for future enhancements.",
      "green": "Could explore alternative depth estimation models, implement batch processing for multiple pets, add material simulation for different wood types, or integrate with other CAM software beyond Fusion 360. Progressive web app version could complement the desktop app.",
      "blue": "Start with core Electron structure, implement photo upload and preview first, then integrate AI models incrementally. Use iterative development with working prototypes at each stage. Focus on the critical path: photo input \u2192 depth estimation \u2192 mesh generation \u2192 STL export."
