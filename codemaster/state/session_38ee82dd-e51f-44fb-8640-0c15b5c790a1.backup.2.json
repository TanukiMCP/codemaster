The main.ts file contains demo implementations for image processing, SVG/STL export, and processing workflows. Real services use OpenCV, Sharp, Three.js, and Python scripts. Ollama integration was recently implemented successfully.",

Users will be excited to see real image processing instead of fake demos. There's satisfaction in connecting well-architected services that are already built. The momentum from successfully implementing Ollama auto-detection gives confidence this will work smoothly.",
      "black": "Risks: Python dependencies might not be installed on user systems. OpenCV and Sharp are heavy dependencies that could cause compilation issues. The excluded services might have bugs since they haven't been tested in the integrated environment. Error handling between services might be incomplete. Processing real images will be much slower than demo delays, potentially causing UI timeouts.",
      "yellow": "Benefits: Users get real AI-powered pet portrait processing instead of fake demos. The app becomes fully functional for its intended purpose. All the hard work of building the services pays off. Performance will be much better than expected since services are well-optimized. This completes the core value proposition of the application.",
      "green": "Creative alternatives: Could implement a hybrid mode with optional demo fallback. Could add progressive processing with real-time preview updates. Could implement service health checks before attempting processing. Could add configuration options for processing quality vs speed tradeoffs. Could implement processing queue for batch operations.",
      "blue": "Process strategy: 1) First integrate services into compilation by updating tsconfig 2) Replace demo handlers with real service calls 3) Add proper error handling and progress tracking 4) Test integration thoroughly 5) Add fallback mechanisms for robustness. Use incremental approach - integrate one service at a time to isolate issues."
