Current wp-mcp has 2419 lines with strong foundations in authentication, content management, and REST API integration. EventPros spec requires automated plugin installation of 6 GeoDirectory plugins, Divi theme setup, and WordPress configuration. Need to research current WordPress REST API, WP-CLI capabilities, and GeoDirectory API endpoints as of July 2025.",
      "red": "Excited about building real automation that eliminates placeholders and delivers on the promise of wp-mcp. Frustrated that current implementation has excellent architecture but critical gaps prevent autonomous execution. Motivated by user's clear request for 'no placeholders' and production-ready code. Concerned about time pressure but energized by opportunity to create truly valuable WordPress automation. The potential to transform wp-mcp from 30% to 90%+ production ready is compelling.",
      "black": "Technical risks include WordPress API changes since training data, potential security vulnerabilities in plugin/theme installation automation, complexity of WP-CLI integration across different hosting environments, and possible breaking changes in GeoDirectory API. Implementation challenges: ensuring secure file operations, handling plugin dependencies and conflicts, managing WordPress database state changes, and providing proper error handling and rollback capabilities. Time constraints and scope creep could impact quality.",

Opportunity to establish wp-mcp as leading WordPress MCP server, provide immediate value to users, and build sustainable competitive advantage. Real implementations will reveal additional enhancement opportunities and validate the architectural decisions. Could become the foundation for WordPress-as-code movement.",
      "green": "Alternative approaches: hybrid WP-CLI + REST API strategy for reliability, containerized WordPress environments for consistent automation, plugin marketplace integration for dynamic installations, and webhook-based deployment pipelines. Could implement progressive enhancement - start with WP-CLI fallbacks, add REST API where possible, include security sandboxing for plugin operations. Consider building enhancement as separate modules that extend core wp-mcp rather than modifying existing handlers directly.",
      "blue": "Organize work in priority-based sprints: 1) Research current APIs and best practices using Context7, 2) Build plugin management system with real installation capability, 3) Implement theme management with Divi-specific features, 4) Add WordPress configuration automation, 5) Enhance GeoDirectory integration with verified endpoints. Use test-driven development with validation at each step. Maintain backward compatibility while adding new functionality. Document all enhancements for future maintenance."

    "denoised_plan": "**WP-MCP Production Enhancement Strategy**\n\n**MISSION**: Transform wp-mcp from 30% to 90%+ production ready by implementing real automation for all critical gaps, enabling autonomous EventPros deployment with zero placeholders.\n\n**CORE STRATEGY**: \nResearch-first approach using Context7 for current WordPress/GeoDirectory APIs, then implement hybrid WP-CLI + REST API solutions for maximum reliability. Build progressive enhancements that extend existing architecture while maintaining backward compatibility.\n\n**EXECUTION PHASES**:\n\n**Phase 1: API Research & Foundation (Priority: Critical)**\n- Research current WordPress REST API, plugin installation methods, and WP-CLI capabilities as of July 2025\n- Verify GeoDirectory API endpoints and installation procedures\n- Identify Divi theme management best practices and automation approaches\n- Document security requirements and implementation patterns\n\n**Phase 2: Plugin Management System (Priority: Critical)**\n- Replace placeholder plugin handlers with real WordPress.org API integration\n- Implement secure plugin download, installation, activation, and dependency management\n- Add plugin conflict detection and rollback capabilities\n- Support both repository plugins and direct ZIP uploads\n\n**Phase 3: Theme Management System (Priority: Critical)**\n- Replace placeholder theme handlers with real installation/activation\n- Implement Divi-specific setup automation including child theme creation\n- Add theme customization and configuration automation\n- Support WordPress.org themes and direct uploads\n\n**Phase 4: WordPress Configuration Automation (Priority: High)**\n- Implement WordPress options API integration for settings management\n- Add permalink, user registration, media, and timezone configuration\n- Build bulk configuration operations with validation and rollback\n\n**Phase 5: Enhanced GeoDirectory Integration (Priority: High)**\n- Verify and implement real GeoDirectory API endpoints\n- Enhance Custom Post Type creation from config-only to actual implementation\n- Add advanced field management and database verification capabilities\n\n**SUCCESS METRICS**: \n100% functional EventPros automation, zero placeholder responses, comprehensive error handling, and production-grade security. Each enhancement must be tested and validated before proceeding to next phase."
