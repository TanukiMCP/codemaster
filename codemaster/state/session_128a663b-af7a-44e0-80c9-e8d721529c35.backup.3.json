      "white": "Critical gaps identified: Plugin management (install/activate placeholders), theme management (install/activate placeholders), WordPress configuration API (missing options handling), WP-CLI integration (missing for advanced operations), and GeoDirectory API verification. Current wp-mcp has 2419 lines with strong foundations in authentication, content management, and REST API integration. EventPros spec requires automated plugin installation of 6 GeoDirectory plugins, Divi theme setup, and WordPress configuration. Need to research current WordPress REST API, WP-CLI capabilities, and GeoDirectory API endpoints as of July 2025.",
      "red": "Excited about building real automation that eliminates placeholders and delivers on the promise of wp-mcp. Frustrated that current implementation has excellent architecture but critical gaps prevent autonomous execution. Motivated by user's clear request for 'no placeholders' and production-ready code. Concerned about time pressure but energized by opportunity to create truly valuable WordPress automation. The potential to transform wp-mcp from 30% to 90%+ production ready is compelling.",
      "black": "Technical risks include WordPress API changes since training data, potential security vulnerabilities in plugin/theme installation automation, complexity of WP-CLI integration across different hosting environments, and possible breaking changes in GeoDirectory API. Implementation challenges: ensuring secure file operations, handling plugin dependencies and conflicts, managing WordPress database state changes, and providing proper error handling and rollback capabilities. Time constraints and scope creep could impact quality.",
      "yellow": "Success transforms wp-mcp into truly enterprise-grade WordPress automation platform, enabling autonomous EventPros deployment and creating reusable infrastructure for future directory projects. Opportunity to establish wp-mcp as leading WordPress MCP server, provide immediate value to users, and build sustainable competitive advantage. Real implementations will reveal additional enhancement opportunities and validate the architectural decisions. Could become the foundation for WordPress-as-code movement.",
      "green": "Alternative approaches: hybrid WP-CLI + REST API strategy for reliability, containerized WordPress environments for consistent automation, plugin marketplace integration for dynamic installations, and webhook-based deployment pipelines. Could implement progressive enhancement - start with WP-CLI fallbacks, add REST API where possible, include security sandboxing for plugin operations. Consider building enhancement as separate modules that extend core wp-mcp rather than modifying existing handlers directly.",
      "blue": "Organize work in priority-based sprints: 1) Research current APIs and best practices using Context7, 2) Build plugin management system with real installation capability, 3) Implement theme management with Divi-specific features, 4) Add WordPress configuration automation, 5) Enhance GeoDirectory integration with verified endpoints. Use test-driven development with validation at each step. Maintain backward compatibility while adding new functionality. Document all enhancements for future maintenance."
