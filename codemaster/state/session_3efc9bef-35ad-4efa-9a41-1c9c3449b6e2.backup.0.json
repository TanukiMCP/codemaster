      "white": "We have a comprehensive design.txt document outlining 13 core implementation tasks for the UI/UX refactor. The existing codebase is an Electron + React + MUI app with Redux state management, Monaco editor integration, and a rich component library. Key gaps include a missing src/App.jsx orchestrator, monolithic CodeEditor (980 LOC), unimplemented MCP tool families, and incomplete feature flagging. The target is production-grade UX with persistent layouts, proper error handling, accessibility, and no placeholder code paths.",
      "red": "This feels like a significant but achievable refactor that will dramatically improve user experience. The systematic approach in design.txt inspires confidence, and the existing foundation is solid. There's excitement about creating a truly professional IDE experience, but some anxiety about the scope and ensuring we don't break existing functionality. The emphasis on accessibility and proper error handling feels right - these details matter for user trust.",
      "black": "Major risks include breaking existing functionality during the decomposition of large components like CodeEditor. The wide scope could lead to incomplete implementations if time runs short. Feature flagging incomplete services requires careful coordination to avoid runtime errors. The onboarding flow and split-pane persistence could introduce new bugs. Accessibility requirements may be more complex than anticipated, especially for complex components like FileExplorer with lazy loading.",
      "yellow": "This refactor will transform Tanuki: AIDE into a production-ready, professional IDE that users will actually want to use daily. The modular component architecture will make future development much easier. Proper error handling and feature flags will eliminate user frustration from broken features. The accessibility improvements will make it usable by a wider audience. The persistent layout and onboarding will create a polished, modern experience that competes with VSCode.",
      "green": "We could leverage React Suspense for lazy loading components, implement progressive enhancement for complex features, use error boundaries more strategically throughout the component tree. Consider using react-split-pane for the layout to get proven split behavior. Could implement a plugin architecture for the feature flags to make them more extensible. The decomposition of CodeEditor offers opportunity to create reusable editor primitives that other components could use.",
      "blue": "Follow the 13-task sequence from design.txt strictly, starting with the App.jsx orchestrator and split-pane layout foundation, then building up the component decomposition and feature flagging. Use parallel tool calls for information gathering, sequential execution for dependent tasks. Create modular, focused commits for each major component. Test each component in isolation before integration. Maintain constant focus on the 'no placeholders' and 'no undefined outputs' standards throughout."

    "denoised_plan": "Execute a systematic UI/UX refactor following the 13-task implementation sequence from design.txt. Start with foundational architecture (App.jsx orchestrator, split-pane layout with persistence) to establish the shell, then decompose monolithic components (CodeEditor) into modular subcomponents. Implement feature flagging early to gate incomplete MCP services and prevent runtime errors. Build robust tooling UX with streaming progress, structured outputs, and proper error handling. Add accessibility throughout with ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, and focus management. Create onboarding flow for workspace initialization. Ensure all paths lead to visible states or clear disabled/unavailable messages with guidance. Use react-split-pane for proven layout behavior, leverage existing design tokens and MUI patterns, and maintain the 'no placeholders, no undefined outputs' standard. Each component should be <200 LOC with single responsibility, properly integrated with Redux state and Electron IPC where needed."
