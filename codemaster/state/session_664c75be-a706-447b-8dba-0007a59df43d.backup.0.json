      "white": "Current facts: The UI has overlapping text, broken single-panel layout, inconsistent chat panel design, and poor visual polish. The app uses React with Material-UI, has an existing design system in themes.js, and includes ResizablePanel components. Key files include App.jsx (main layout), ChatPanel.jsx (needs restructuring), and various component files that need design system application.",
      "red": "User frustration is evident from the 'terrible' UI description. The current experience likely feels broken and unprofessional. Users expect a polished, intuitive interface where they can work efficiently without visual distractions. The emotional goal is to create a sense of professionalism and delight when using the application.",
      "black": "Main risks include: breaking existing functionality while restructuring, introducing new layout bugs, performance issues with complex multi-panel layouts, inconsistent component behavior, and potential accessibility problems. The large ChatPanel component (633 lines) suggests complex state management that could be fragile during refactoring.",
      "yellow": "Opportunities include: dramatically improved user experience, better workflow efficiency with multi-panel layout, consistent visual language across the app, improved maintainability through component standardization, and enhanced professional appearance. Success will create a modern, polished application that users love to use.",
      "green": "Creative solutions: Extract ChatPanel sub-components for better maintainability, create a standardized PanelContainer component for consistency, implement smooth panel transitions and animations, use CSS Grid/Flexbox for robust layouts, apply design system tokens systematically, and create reusable UI patterns that can be applied everywhere.",
      "blue": "Process strategy: First analyze the current layout architecture, then redesign App.jsx for multi-panel layout, create standardized components like PanelContainer, systematically refactor major components like ChatPanel, apply design system consistently across all components, and ensure every UI element is polished with no placeholders remaining. Focus purely on frontend aesthetics without backend changes."

    "denoised_plan": "**UI AESTHETICS OVERHAUL PLAN**\n\n**Core Strategy**: Transform the broken single-panel layout into a polished, professional multi-panel interface while maintaining all existing functionality. Focus exclusively on frontend UI/UX aesthetics without backend modifications.\n\n**Phase 1: Layout Architecture Redesign**\n- Analyze current App.jsx layout problems and design flaws\n- Redesign App.jsx to implement proper multi-panel layout using ResizablePanel components\n- Create responsive layout that handles panel visibility and resizing gracefully\n- Establish proper component boundaries and z-index management to eliminate text overlapping\n\n**Phase 2: Component Standardization**\n- Create PanelContainer component for consistent panel headers, styling, and behavior\n- Refactor ChatPanel.jsx by extracting sub-components (Header, Planning, Messages, Input)\n- Apply design system tokens consistently across all major components\n- Eliminate all placeholder content and ensure 100% polished UI elements\n\n**Phase 3: Visual Polish & Consistency**\n- Standardize spacing, typography, colors, and interactive elements using design system\n- Implement smooth animations and transitions for panel operations\n- Ensure consistent button styles, input fields, hover states across all components\n- Apply accessibility improvements and ensure professional visual appearance\n\n**Success Criteria**: Zero text overlaps, smooth multi-panel workflow, consistent visual language, no placeholder content, and a professional user experience that eliminates current frustrations."
