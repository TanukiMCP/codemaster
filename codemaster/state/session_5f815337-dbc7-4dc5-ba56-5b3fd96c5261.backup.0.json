There's satisfaction in creating a legitimate professional directory that will genuinely help people find quality service providers. However, there's also some nervousness about ensuring we respect website terms of service and collect data ethically while being thorough and efficient.",
      "black": "Main risks include potential rate limiting or blocking from websites if we browse too aggressively, inconsistent data quality across different sources and cities, and the time-intensive nature of manually collecting 110 businesses. Some sites may have anti-scraping measures, and ensuring data accuracy while maintaining efficiency could be challenging. There's also risk of incomplete or outdated business information.",

Using authentic data from verified sources will establish trust and credibility for EventPros.com. The CSV format allows easy manipulation and import, and Puppeteer provides reliable automation. Multiple source validation will ensure comprehensive, accurate business information that competitors using fake data can't match.",

Could also create progressive data collection where we verify and enhance initial findings through multiple source checks.",

Establish consistent workflows for each business type, document all sources and validation methods, use city-by-city systematic approach, and maintain quality control throughout.

Implement respectful browsing patterns with natural delays to avoid rate limiting, establish consistent data collection templates for each business type, and cross-validate information across multiple sources for accuracy. Prioritize data quality over speed, document all sources for compliance, and create structured CSV outputs with complete business information including contact details, specializations, pricing, and service areas.
